You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to be able to define the basic information of vehicles, including vehicle mass, current status, engine, and driver, etc. The vehicle status should be able to describe gear setting and accelerator pedal position. Each vehicle should have one engine component and can be associated with a driver. The system should also support independent modeling and management of engine and personnel components. Through this system, users can comprehensively track and manage key parameters and operating status of vehicles, thereby supporting subsequent business analysis and operational needs.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
