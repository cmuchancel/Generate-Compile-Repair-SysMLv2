This is because the enum members in SysML v2 are defined with the keyword `enum` and then the members.\n 2. At line 9: Unexpected '}'. This is a consequence of the enum definition being incorrect.\n 3. At line 23: No Feature named 'Park' found. This is because the enum definition was not properly defined, so the reference to `GearSetting::Park` fails.\n\n Let's recall the correct way to define an enum in SysML v2:\n    enum def GearSetting {\n        enum Park;\n        enum Reverse;\n        enum Neutral;\n        enum Drive;\n    }\n\n However, note that the error message from the previous attempt shows that the enum members were listed without the `enum` keyword.\n\n Let's adjust the enum definition accordingly.\n\n Also, note that the previous model had:\n    part driver : Driver[0..1];\n This is acceptable for an optional driver.\n\n We'll keep the rest of the model as it was, since the other parts were accepted.\n\n Let's rewrite the model with the corrected enum definition.\n\n Important: We are to output only the SysML text with no prose or markdown.\n\n We are to use a conservative subset and avoid constructs that frequently fail validation.\n\n We are to apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.\n\n Let's write the corrected model."
