You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system shall be capable of performing automated simulation and analysis of vehicle dynamic behavior. Users should be able to input the vehicle’s initial velocity, initial position, acceleration at a specific moment, and the time step. Through integration with the ModelCenter analysis tool, the system shall automatically calculate and output the vehicle’s velocity and position after the specified time step based on the given physical model. The system must ensure accurate data transfer and reliable output of simulation results, enabling users to conveniently obtain key dynamic parameters to support vehicle performance analysis and design optimization.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
