You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to realize the torque generation function within the powertrain system. The system should include relevant components capable of generating torque, and it is required that the torque produced during operation must be greater than zero newton-meters to ensure driving capability. During the design and implementation process, the logic layer's torque generator function should be effectively allocated and mapped to the physical layer of the powertrain (including actual components such as the engine), thereby ensuring the actual generation and transmission of torque to meet the overall vehicle power output requirements.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
