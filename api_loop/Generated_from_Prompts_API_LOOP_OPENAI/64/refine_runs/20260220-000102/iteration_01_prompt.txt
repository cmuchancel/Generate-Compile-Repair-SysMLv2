You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to manage and regulate vehicle mass in compliance with relevant standards. A vehicle consists of three parts: the chassis, the engine, and the transmission, each with its own mass. The system requires that the total mass of the complete vehicle (i.e., the sum of the masses of the chassis, engine, and transmission) must not exceed 2,500 kilograms in order to meet vehicle mass compliance requirements. The system is capable of receiving the actual mass data of each component and automatically verifying whether their total exceeds the specified upper mass limit, thus ensuring that vehicle design and manufacturing conform to the applicable standards and regulatory requirements regarding mass. This mechanism helps ensure that the vehicle meets requirements concerning safety, performance, and regulatory compliance.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
