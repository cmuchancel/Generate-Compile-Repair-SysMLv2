You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to perform hierarchical modeling and aggregation of the quality (mass) information of vehicles and their components, facilitating automatic calculation and management of the total vehicle mass. In the system, each object with a quantifiable mass can either be a simple component or a composite object assembled from other components. Every component contains its own mass information and can automatically aggregate the total mass of itself and all its subcomponents. For example, the total mass of a complete vehicle includes the body itself as well as all parts such as the engine, transmission, and other components. Core components such as the engine and transmission are explicitly defined and assigned under the whole vehicle, and their data can be individually specified. Through this model, users can quickly acquire the total mass of a specific vehicle, while the numbering and weight information of any component can be clearly recorded, achieving transparency, automated statistics, and traceability of vehicle mass.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
