You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to verify vehicle mass compliance to ensure that the actual mass of the tested vehicles does not exceed the specified maximum permissible mass. Specifically, each participating vehicle must have its actual mass measured using weighing equipment operated by a test operator. The system then compares the measured mass with the required value (e.g., a maximum permissible mass of 2,500 kilograms). If the vehicle's actual mass is less than or equal to the strictly defined upper limit, it is considered compliant; otherwise, it is deemed non-compliant. The system supports sequential testing and result determination for multiple vehicles, providing a reliable and automated solution for compliance management of vehicle-related product quality.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
