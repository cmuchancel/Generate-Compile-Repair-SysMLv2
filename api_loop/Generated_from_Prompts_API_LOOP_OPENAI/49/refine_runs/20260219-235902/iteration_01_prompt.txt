You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to provide a message interaction mechanism for vehicles equipped with cruise control functionality. Drivers can send set speed commands, which are first processed by the cruise controller upon receipt. The cruise controller then reads real-time speed information from the speed sensor (speedometer). Based on the difference between the set speed and the actual speed, the cruise controller calculates and generates a fuel control command. This fuel control command is first transmitted to the engine controller for processing, after which the engine controller forwards the command to the engine to ultimately control fuel flow and achieve speed adjustment and stabilization. Throughout the entire process, each system component communicates and collaborates via standardized message interfaces, thereby ensuring reliable, efficient, and safe operation of the cruise control function.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
