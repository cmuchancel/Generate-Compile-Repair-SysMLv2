You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to describe and constrain the composition and mass requirements of a vehicle. The vehicle consists of three main components: the chassis, the engine, and the transmission, each with its own mass attribute. The system requires that the total mass of all vehicle components must not exceed 2,500 kilograms. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the vehicle is considered: the system supports modeling the vehicle's dynamic constraints under known initial velocity, final velocity, mass, applied force, and over a given period of time, ensuring that the mass must be greater than zero, and that the physical relationship among force, time, and change in velocity is satisfied. Through these constraints, the system can be used during vehicle design to verify the rationality of total mass and dynamic performance.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
