You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to provide automatic braking control functions for vehicles. When the user turns the vehicle key to the start position, the system is automatically activated and continuously monitors the status of the brake pedal as well as traction information such as road adhesion. By detecting the brake pressure generated when the driver presses the brake pedal and evaluating traction variations under different road conditions, the system can intelligently adjust the brake pressure and modulation frequency during the braking process. This ensures that the vehicle achieves safe and reliable braking performance under various operating conditions, thereby enhancing driving safety and comfort. The entire process is automatically monitored and dynamically regulated without user intervention, ensuring that the braking system always operates in its optimal state.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
