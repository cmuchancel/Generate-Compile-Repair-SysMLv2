You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system is designed to provide end users with a convenient and efficient mode of transportation. It is capable of supporting a driver and up to four passengers sharing a vehicle, enabling them to travel safely and comfortably from the starting point to the destination. Users can freely enter and exit the vehicle, and the system should ensure that this process is simple and smooth. In addition, the system should fully consider and integrate surrounding environmental factors to ensure the safety and sustainability of the entire journey, while also being compatible with related infrastructure such as gas stations. The system’s operation should be centered on human needs, with a focus on ride experience and various conveniences, assisting passengers and drivers in smoothly completing all kinds of daily transportation tasks.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
