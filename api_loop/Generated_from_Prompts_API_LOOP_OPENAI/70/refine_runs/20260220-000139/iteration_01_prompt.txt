You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system model of this project primarily outlines the basic requirements for a vehicle and its engine. The vehicle's total mass must not exceed 2000 kilograms when fully fueled, and should not be higher than 1500 kilograms when empty. The engine must be capable of effectively transmitting its generated torque to the transmission system through a clutch interface, and the torque generated by the engine should vary with speed, conforming to the relevant performance table specifications. The design of both the vehicle and its engine must meet these critical requirements for mass and power interface to ensure overall vehicle performance and safety.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
