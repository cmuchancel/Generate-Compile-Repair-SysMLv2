You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system requires that the total mass of the vehicle (including curb weight and fuel mass) must not exceed the specified maximum mass limit, and the fuel mass must be a positive value. In addition, the engine must be able to generate corresponding torque according to the speed curve, and the torque produced by the engine must be effectively transmitted to the transmission through the clutch interface to ensure that power is smoothly delivered to the vehicle’s drive system.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
