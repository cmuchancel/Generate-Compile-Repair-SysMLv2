You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to establish a document management platform related to automobiles. It can manage and record information and documentation about automobiles, allowing users to enter, query, and archive various types of information using “Automobile” as the core object. The system also provides “Car” as an alias for “Automobile,” enabling different user groups to perform searches and operations flexibly according to their own habits. In addition, the system supports compatibility with standard physical quantity systems, enabling unified referencing and management of physical quantities such as torque (e.g., TorqueValue under the ISQ standard) to enhance the professionalism and accuracy of documentation. The system allows explanatory documents to be added for different objects and their aliases, ensuring that information within the platform is clearly annotated and traceable. In this way, the platform better serves the documentation management and knowledge accumulation needs of users in the automotive industry.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package AutomobileDocumentManagement {
  private import ScalarValues::*;

  item def Document {
    attribute title : String;
    attribute content : String;
  }

  part def Automobile {
    attribute vin : String;
    attribute model : String;
    attribute torque : TorqueValue;
    attribute description : String;
  }

  part def Car {
    attribute aliasName : String = "Car";
    attribute automobile : Automobile;
    attribute description : String;
  }

  part def DocumentationLink {
    attribute document : Document;
    attribute targetAutomobile : Automobile;
    attribute targetCar : Car;
  }

  part def Platform {
    part automobiles : Automobile[0..*];
    part cars : Car[0..*];
    part documents : Document[0..*];
    part links : DocumentationLink[0..*];
  }
}

SYSIDE COMPILER FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS:
            iteration_01.sysml:12:24: error (reference-error): No Type named 'TorqueValue' found.
12 |     attribute torque : TorqueValue;
   |                        ^^^^^^^^^^^

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
