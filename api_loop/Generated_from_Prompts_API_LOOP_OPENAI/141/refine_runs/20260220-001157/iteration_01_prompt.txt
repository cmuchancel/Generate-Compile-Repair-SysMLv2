You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to provide a standardized unit system library that supports the interoperability and adaptation between the International System of Quantities (ISQ) and United States Customary Units (USCustomaryUnits). The goal is to enable users to conveniently manage, convert, and apply various units of physical quantities, effectively reducing confusion and errors caused by inconsistent units. At the same time, the system must ensure the accuracy and authoritative standardization of all unit types, meeting the measurement needs of engineering, scientific research, and daily life. This will enhance the efficiency and reliability of data processing and communication.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
