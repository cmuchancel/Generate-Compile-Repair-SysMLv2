You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system must possess a clear capability for structural decomposition, namely, the ability to explicitly present a top-down hierarchical structure, dividing the system into multiple subsystems and components, and ensuring that the functions and capabilities of each level are fully covered. The interfaces between system components should be well defined, so that each component can be independently understood and analyzed while also collaborating effectively within the overall system. Furthermore, system engineers and parties involved in Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) must be able to use this structural view to comprehend and verify the system’s integrity and modular design, thereby ensuring that the system's various functional and performance requirements are met.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
