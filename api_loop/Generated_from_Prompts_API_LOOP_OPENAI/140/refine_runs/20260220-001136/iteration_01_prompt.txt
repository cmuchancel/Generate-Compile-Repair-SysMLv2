You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system must be capable of supporting and managing data and units related to physical quantities, and is required to cover various base physical quantities in the International System of Quantities (ISQ), such as length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. The system should also allow for corresponding import and extension. It must ensure accurate representation of relevant physical quantities and consistency of information, facilitating physical quantity data processing and unit conversion operations in subsequent engineering or scientific development. The system must meet users' diverse requirements for managing physical quantity systems.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
