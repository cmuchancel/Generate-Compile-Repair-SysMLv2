You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to support the photography workflow, allowing users to select a scene and capture it as a photograph. In the shooting process, the selected scene is first focused to ensure optimal image sharpness. If the camera detects that the focus is clear, it will proceed to take the photo, generating the final image. The entire process automatically performs focusing and shooting operations in sequence, providing users with a convenient one-click shooting experience while ensuring the clarity and quality of the photos.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
