You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
            This system is a vehicle feature annotation system, designed to identify and manage the safety and anti-theft (security and protection) configurations of various parts within a complete vehicle model. The vehicle should be equipped with basic safety features such as seat belts, driver airbags, and bumpers, as well as security features including anti-theft alarms and keyless entry systems. 

The system structure covers two main assemblies: the interior and the body assembly. The interior includes components such as seat belts, front seats, driver airbag, and alarm system, while the body assembly includes the body shell, bumpers, and keyless entry device. The system must clearly indicate the distribution of these components within the vehicle structure and specify their respective safety or protection functions, so as to comprehensively meet requirements for automotive safety and protection, user convenience, and property security.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
