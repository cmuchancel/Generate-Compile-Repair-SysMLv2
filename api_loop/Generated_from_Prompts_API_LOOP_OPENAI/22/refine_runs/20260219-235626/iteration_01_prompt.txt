You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
In this system, users can complete the entire photography process—from composition to imaging to photo output—through a software package called "PhotographyWorkflow." When a user needs to take a photograph, the system first focuses (Focus) on the captured scene (Scene) to generate a frame of image (Image). The system then performs a shooting (Shoot) operation on the focused image to ultimately produce a photograph (Picture). Users only need to input the desired scene to be photographed; the system will automatically complete the focusing and imaging operations and directly output the required photograph, thereby realizing an automated and streamlined photography workflow.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
