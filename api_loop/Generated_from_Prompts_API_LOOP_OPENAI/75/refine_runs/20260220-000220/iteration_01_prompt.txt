You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
To ensure that the quality of vehicles meets relevant requirements, the system needs to check the curb weight of each vehicle. The curb weight of each vehicle must be less than or equal to 2,500 kilograms. The relevant tests include collecting the actual weight data of the vehicle, processing the collected data, and using the processed data as the basis to determine whether the vehicle's weight meets the specified standards, ultimately producing a qualified or unqualified evaluation result. This process must have clear steps of data collection, processing, and evaluation to ensure the scientific and accurate detection of vehicle quality.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
