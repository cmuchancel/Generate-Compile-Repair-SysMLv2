You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to support vehicle modeling. Each vehicle should include quality attributes and be able to specify driver information, as well as be equipped with an independent fuel tank. The fuel tank must be able to store a specific type of fuel. In addition, the system should have the capability to define and manage basic information such as fuel and personnel, in order to provide necessary data support for the vehicle model. Overall, there should be clear associations between each element to ensure a comprehensive description of vehicles and their components.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
