You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to manage the power status of a vehicle, enabling automatic switching between different operating states according to various control signals. When the user sends a vehicle start command, the system switches the vehicle from the off state to the start phase, and upon receiving the vehicle started signal, it enters the vehicle powered-on state. During the powered-on period, the system automatically performs self-diagnosis operations and continuously supplies power to various functional units of the vehicle. When the user issues a vehicle shutdown command, the system automatically executes safety operations such as parking brake engagement and returns the vehicle to the off state to cut off the power supply, ensuring safety. This entire process realizes intelligent control and state management of the vehicle's power supply, thereby enhancing the convenience and safety of vehicle use.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

    enum PoweredOn;

  port def ControlPort {
    attribute startCommand : Boolean;

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
