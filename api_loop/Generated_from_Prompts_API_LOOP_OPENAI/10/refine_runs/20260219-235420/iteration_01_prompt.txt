You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to achieve effective management of fuel flow. It consists of two main components: the fuel tank assembly and the engine. The fuel tank supplies fuel to the engine through a dedicated port, and can also receive excess fuel returned from the engine. Throughout the entire fuel transfer process, temperature information can be detected and transmitted at the interface to ensure the safety and efficiency of fuel supply. Users can obtain real-time data on fuel supply, return flow, and related temperature parameters, enabling visualized monitoring and precise control of fuel flow status. This effectively meets the engine's requirements for fuel management during operation.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
