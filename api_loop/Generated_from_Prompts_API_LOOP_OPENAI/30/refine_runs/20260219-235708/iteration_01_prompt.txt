You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement the shooting process of a digital camera, enabling users to complete the entire procedure from viewfinding and focusing to imaging with a single, simple operation. Users only need to select the shooting scene; the camera will then automatically focus on the selected scene and generate an image that meets the requirements, after which the imaging module will capture and produce the final photo. The entire shooting process is fully automated without the need for users to manually adjust the focus or initiate imaging. All functional modules collaborate to complete the entire process of shooting and image acquisition, ensuring an efficient and convenient shooting experience and outputting high-quality photos.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
