You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to ensure that the combined weight of the main vehicle components (including the chassis, engine, and transmission) does not exceed 2,500 kilograms. The system must be able to accurately record and manage the weight of each component, with the weight data for the chassis, engine, and transmission all required as inputs. The system should automatically sum the weights of these components, and when the total weight exceeds the specified limit, it must provide a warning or impose restrictions to ensure that the designed vehicle’s total weight complies with relevant regulatory requirements, thereby ensuring product legality, compliance, and safety.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
