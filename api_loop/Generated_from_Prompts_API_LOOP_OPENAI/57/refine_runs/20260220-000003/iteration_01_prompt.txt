You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used for the aggregation and management of the mass of objects with mass attributes. Each object has a basic mass and can also contain several subcomponents. The system can automatically calculate the total mass, including all subcomponents. For supported composite objects, the total mass equals the sum of the object's own basic mass and the full mass of all its subcomponents. In addition, the system supports mass-based filtering and aggregation of components; that is, a minimum mass threshold can be set so that only subcomponents whose mass is not less than this threshold are counted. In this case, the total mass is the sum of the object's own mass and the mass of all subcomponents that meet the specified minimum mass requirement. This system is suitable for hierarchical decomposition and overall mass control of complex products or equipment structures, enabling users to flexibly aggregate mass information from different dimensions according to actual needs.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
