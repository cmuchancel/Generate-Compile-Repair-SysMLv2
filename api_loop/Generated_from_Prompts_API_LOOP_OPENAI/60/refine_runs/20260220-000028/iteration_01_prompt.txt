You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to model and compute the vehicle's driving dynamics. Based on user input parameters such as vehicle mass, wheel power, aerodynamic drag coefficient, and rolling resistance coefficient, together with initial speed and position, the system automatically calculates and updates the vehicle's speed and position at each time step. The system comprehensively accounts for the effects of air resistance and frictional resistance on vehicle dynamics and uses this information to predict the vehicle's velocity, acceleration, displacement, and other dynamic states over time. This assists end users in analyzing vehicle performance under different operating conditions, thereby enabling the automation and efficient management of vehicle dynamics simulation.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
