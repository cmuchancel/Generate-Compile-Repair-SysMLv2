You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to support photography workflows, allowing users to frame and capture a scene. First, the user selects a specific scene, and the system performs a focusing process on the selected scene to generate an image. Then, based on this image, the system carries out the shooting process to produce a final photograph. The overall workflow automatically completes the focusing and shooting steps, ensuring that users can conveniently convert the scenes they see into high-quality photographs without manually handling intermediate image processing and conversion tasks.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package PhotographyWorkflow {
  private import ScalarValues::*;

  item def Scene;
  item def Image;
  item def Photograph;

  port def ScenePort {
    item scene : Scene;
  }

  port def ImagePort {
    item image : Image;
  }

  port def PhotoPort {
    item photo : Photograph;
  }

  part def User {
    port sceneSelection : ScenePort;
    port photoIn : PhotoPort;
  }

  part def FocusingProcess {
    port sceneIn : ScenePort;
    port imageOut : ImagePort;
    attribute focused : Boolean = true;
  }

  part def ShootingProcess {
    port imageIn : ImagePort;
    port photoOut : PhotoPort;
    attribute shot : Boolean = true;
  }

  part def WorkflowSystem {
    part focusing : FocusingProcess;
    part shooting : ShootingProcess;
    port sceneIn : ScenePort;
    port photoOut : PhotoPort;
    attribute automaticWorkflow : Boolean = true;
    connect sceneIn to focusing.sceneIn;
    connect focusing.imageOut to shooting.imageIn;
    connect shooting.photoOut to photoOut;
  }

  part def PhotographyWorkflow {
    part user : User;
    part system : WorkflowSystem;
    connect user.sceneSelection to system.sceneIn;
    connect system.photoOut to user.photoIn;
  }

  part workflow : PhotographyWorkflow;
}
