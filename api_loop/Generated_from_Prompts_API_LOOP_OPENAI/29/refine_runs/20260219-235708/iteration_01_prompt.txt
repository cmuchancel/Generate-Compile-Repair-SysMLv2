You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement a camera function capable of taking photos of various scenes. The system includes automatic focusing on objects within the scene and the imaging process. When the user selects a scene, the camera first obtains a clear and realistic image through the autofocus subsystem. Afterwards, the imaging subsystem captures this image as a photograph. All photos taken are recorded and saved by the system. Users do not need to concern themselves with the internal technical details; they only need to select or confirm the scene to be photographed, and the camera will automatically complete the focusing and imaging operations to generate high-quality photos for the user.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
