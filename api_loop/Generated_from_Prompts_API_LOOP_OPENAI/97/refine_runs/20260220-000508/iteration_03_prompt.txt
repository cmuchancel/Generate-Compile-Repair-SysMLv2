You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system involves the definition of vehicles, including basic vehicles, engines, and the configuration of engine cylinders. In standard vehicles, each engine contains 4 to 6 cylinders. For small vehicles, the engine is required to contain only 4 cylinders; for large vehicles, the engine needs to be equipped with 6 cylinders. The system should automatically select and configure the appropriate number of engine cylinders according to the vehicle size to meet the practical application requirements of different types of vehicles.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 2):
                package VehicleModel {
  private import ScalarValues::*;

  enum def VehicleSize { small; standardSize; large; }

  part def Engine {
    attribute cylinderCount : Integer;
  }

  part def Engine4 specializes Engine {
    attribute cylinderCount = 4;
  }

  part def Engine6 specializes Engine {
    attribute cylinderCount = 6;
  }

  part def Vehicle {
    attribute size : VehicleSize;
    part engine : Engine;
  }

  part def SmallVehicle specializes Vehicle {
    attribute size = small;
    part engine : Engine4;
  }

  part def LargeVehicle specializes Vehicle {
    attribute size = large;
    part engine : Engine6;
  }

  part def StandardVehicle4 specializes Vehicle {
    attribute size = standardSize;
    part engine : Engine4;
  }

  part def StandardVehicle6 specializes Vehicle {
    attribute size = standardSize;
    part engine : Engine6;
  }
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
