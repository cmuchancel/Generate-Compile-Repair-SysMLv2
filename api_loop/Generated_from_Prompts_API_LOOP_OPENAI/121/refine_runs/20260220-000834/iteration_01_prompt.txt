You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to provide optimal solutions for vehicle powertrain configuration, focusing primarily on the trade-off analysis of engine types to select the engine configuration that performs best across multiple key performance indicators, including power, mass, efficiency, reliability, and cost. The system supports modeling of various engine structures (such as four-cylinder engines, six-cylinder engines, etc.), and is capable of automatically assembling related components, including cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, and crankshafts. A multi-attribute trade-off analysis method is used, and, through a pre-defined evaluation model, the system comprehensively assesses the performance data of different engine schemes. Based on the evaluation results, it automatically recommends the optimal engine solution, ensuring the best balance between vehicle performance and economy. At the same time, it allows users to view explanations on the rationality of the engine selection, ensuring decision transparency and traceability.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
