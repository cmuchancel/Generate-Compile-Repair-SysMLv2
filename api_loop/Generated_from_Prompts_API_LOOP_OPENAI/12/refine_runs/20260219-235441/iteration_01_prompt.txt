You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement a water supply network that delivers hot and cold water from a main supply pipe (SpigotBank) through corresponding interfaces (Spigot) to one or more faucets (Faucet). Each faucet is equipped with hot and cold water inlets (FaucetInlet). The system is required to reliably deliver hot and cold water from the respective outlets of the main supply pipe to the corresponding inlets of all downstream faucets, ensuring simultaneous supply to multiple water usage points. Additionally, the system must guarantee correct connection and smooth transmission of the hot and cold water pipelines, thereby meeting the basic requirements for distributed hot and cold water supply in various settings.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
