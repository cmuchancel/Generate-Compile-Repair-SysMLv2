You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The vehicle safety compliance system requires that all components of the vehicle possess corresponding safety features, some of which are mandatory. The vehicle interior must be equipped with two seat belts, and both seat belts are required safety features. Additionally, the driver’s airbag is an optional safety feature and is not mandatory. For the vehicle body, a bumper is required as a mandatory safety component, while the keyless entry system is a non-mandatory configuration. In the chassis system, the number of tires is fixed, and the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is an optional safety feature. Furthermore, the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts and further distinguishes which safety components are required by law or industry standards and which are non-mandatory configurations, ensuring that the vehicle meets fundamental safety standards while offering more optional safety functions.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
