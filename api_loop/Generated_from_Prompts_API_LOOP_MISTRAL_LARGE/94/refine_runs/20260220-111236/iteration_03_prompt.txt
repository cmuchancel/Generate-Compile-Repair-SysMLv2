You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system model aims to provide standardized definitions and annotations for fundamental concepts and elements in the automotive domain. In the model, “汽车” (automobile) is designated as a core component, with the alias “汽车 (Car)” defined to facilitate communication and usage in various application scenarios. The model also includes comprehensive explanatory comments to help developers and users better understand the meaning and application context of each element. Additionally, the model associates relevant physical quantities such as “扭矩 (Torque)” to ensure standardized and consistent expression of automotive characteristics. The overall design emphasizes clarity and extensibility, enabling convenient development, integration, and maintenance of subsequent automotive-related systems.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

    private import ScalarValues::*;

    /* Core automobile definition with alias */
    part def Car {
        attribute alias : String = "汽车 (Car)";
        doc /* The central component representing an automobile in the model. */
    }

    /* Physical quantities for automotive characteristics */
    attribute def Torque : Real {
        doc /* Torque, measured in Newton-meters (Nm). */
    }

    /* Additional automotive physical quantities */
    attribute def Speed : Real {
        doc /* Speed, measured in kilometers per hour (km/h). */
    }

    attribute def Power : Real {
        doc /* Power, measured in kilowatts (kW). */
    }

    attribute def FuelConsumption : Real {
        doc /* Fuel consumption, measured in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km). */
    }

    /* Example automobile instance */
    part myCar : Car {

        attribute power : Power = 150.0;
