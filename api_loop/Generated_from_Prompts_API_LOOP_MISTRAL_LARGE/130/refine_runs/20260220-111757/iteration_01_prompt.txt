You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system proposes the following requirements for the safety and security compliance configurations of a vehicle: The vehicle interior must be equipped with two seat belts, which are mandatory safety features. An airbag should also be installed in the cockpit, but its application is not mandatory. Additionally, an anti-theft alarm device should be installed inside the vehicle to enhance security protection. The vehicle body must be equipped with a bumper, which is a required safety component, and is also required to have a keyless entry system to improve security performance. The chassis structure is to be fitted with two wheels and equipped with two sets of anti-lock braking systems, although the installation of such braking systems is not mandatory. All the aforementioned components related to safety and security are subject to identification and classification management by the system to ensure compliance with regulations regarding critical safety and security functions, thereby enhancing the vehicle’s overall safety and security features.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
