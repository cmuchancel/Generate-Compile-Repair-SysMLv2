You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement continuous monitoring and control during the battery charging process. Once charging begins, the system continuously monitors the current battery level (displayed as a percentage). If the battery level is below 100%, it will automatically replenish the battery. This cycle repeats until the battery level reaches or exceeds 100%, at which point the system automatically terminates the charging process. The entire charging operation is fully automated, requiring no manual intervention, thereby ensuring the battery is safely and reliably fully charged while preventing overcharging.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package BatteryChargingSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def ChargingState {
        enum MONITORING;
        enum CHARGING;
        enum TERMINATED;
    }

    part def Battery {
        attribute level : Real;
        attribute state : ChargingState = ChargingState::MONITORING;
    }

    part def Charger {
        port powerOut : PowerPort;
    }

    port def PowerPort;

    part def MonitoringSystem {
        attribute currentLevel : Real;
        attribute targetLevel : Real = 100.0;
        attribute threshold : Real = 100.0;

        part battery : Battery;
        part charger : Charger;

        connect battery to charger.powerOut;
    }

    part system : MonitoringSystem;

    item def ChargingCycle {
        attribute isActive : Boolean = true;
    }
}
