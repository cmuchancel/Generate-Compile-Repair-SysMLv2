You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system should enable users to obtain photos from real-world scenes. Specifically, after a user selects a scene they wish to capture, the system should first automatically perform focusing for the selected scene and generate an intermediate image. Next, based on the focused image, the system should capture and output the final photo. Ultimately, users can directly obtain photos that meet their requirements from the selected scene, while the system completes the focusing and shooting processes automatically in the background, without requiring manual intervention at each step.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package PhotoCaptureSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def FocusStatus {
        enum UNFOCUSED;
        enum FOCUSING;
        enum FOCUSED;
    }

    part def Camera {
        attribute focusStatus : FocusStatus = FocusStatus::UNFOCUSED;
        attribute intermediateImage : Image;
        attribute finalPhoto : Image;

        port captureRequest : CaptureRequestPort;
        port focusControl : FocusControlPort;
        port imageOutput : ImageOutputPort;
    }

    part def User {
        port sceneSelection : SceneSelectionPort;
    }

    part def Scene {
    }

    part def Image {
    }

    port def CaptureRequestPort {
    }

    port def FocusControlPort {
    }

    port def ImageOutputPort {
    }

    port def SceneSelectionPort {
    }

    part system :> Camera {
        part user : User;
        part scene : Scene;
    }

    connect system.user.sceneSelection to system.captureRequest;
    connect system.focusControl to system;
    connect system to system.imageOutput;
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.
