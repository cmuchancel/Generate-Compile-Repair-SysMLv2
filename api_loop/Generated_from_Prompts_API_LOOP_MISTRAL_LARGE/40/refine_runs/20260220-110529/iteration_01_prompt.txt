You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to enable intelligent monitoring and management of vehicle health status. During normal operation, the system automatically senses the current vehicle temperature and compares it with the preset maximum allowable temperature. If the vehicle temperature exceeds the maximum allowable value, the system promptly sends an over-temperature warning to the vehicle controller and switches the vehicle health status to "degraded" mode; when the temperature returns to a safe range, the status automatically reverts to normal. In addition, the vehicle undergoes periodic maintenance at scheduled intervals. When the specified maintenance time is reached, the system automatically enters maintenance status, and after maintenance is completed, the next maintenance cycle time is updated. After the maintenance status has lasted for 48 hours, the vehicle automatically returns to normal operating status. This system operates automatically, helping users to detect and address vehicle over-temperature and maintenance needs in a timely manner, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of vehicle operation and reducing manual intervention.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
