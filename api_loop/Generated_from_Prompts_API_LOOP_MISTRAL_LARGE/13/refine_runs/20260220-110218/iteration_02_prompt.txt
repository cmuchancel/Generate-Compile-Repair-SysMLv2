You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to provide complete fuel supply and return management functions for vehicles. The vehicle is equipped with a fuel system composed of a fuel tank assembly, which integrates both the fuel pump and the fuel tank. The fuel pump is responsible for pressurizing fuel from the tank and delivering it to various fuel-consuming units within the vehicle, while allowing unused fuel to return to the tank via the return line. The system must monitor and transmit real-time fuel temperature information to ensure the safety and efficiency of fuel transport. The overall fuel flow path and interface definitions are clearly specified, and both data and fuel flow between components are strictly bound according to the design, thereby achieving reliable fuel supply and effective return management.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package FuelSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def FuelFlowDirection {
        enum supply;
        enum return;
    }

    part def FuelTankAssembly {
        attribute capacity : Real;
        attribute currentFuelLevel : Real;
        part fuelPump : FuelPump;
        part fuelTank : FuelTank;
    }

    part def FuelPump {
        attribute isActive : Boolean;
        attribute pressure : Real;
        port fuelOut : FuelSupplyPort;
        port fuelReturn : FuelReturnPort;
    }

    part def FuelTank {
        attribute temperature : Real;
        port fuelIn : FuelReturnPort;
        port fuelOut : FuelSupplyPort;
    }

    part def FuelConsumingUnit {
        port fuelIn : FuelSupplyPort;
        port fuelReturn : FuelReturnPort;
    }

    port def FuelSupplyPort {
        attribute direction : FuelFlowDirection = FuelFlowDirection::supply;
    }

    port def FuelReturnPort {
        attribute direction : FuelFlowDirection = FuelFlowDirection::return;
    }

    item def Fuel {
        attribute temperature : Real;
    }

    part vehicleFuelSystem : FuelTankAssembly {
        part engine : FuelConsumingUnit;
        part auxiliaryUnit : FuelConsumingUnit;

        connect fuelTank.fuelOut to fuelPump.fuelOut;
        connect fuelPump.fuelOut to engine.fuelIn;
        connect engine.fuelReturn to fuelTank.fuelIn;
        connect fuelPump.fuelReturn to fuelTank.fuelIn;
        connect auxiliaryUnit.fuelReturn to fuelTank.fuelIn;
    }
