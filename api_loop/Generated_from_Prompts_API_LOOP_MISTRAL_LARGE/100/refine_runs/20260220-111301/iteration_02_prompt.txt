You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed for modeling configuration variants of vehicles. The core components include the complete vehicle, front and rear axles, and tires, with key attributes such as mass defined for each. The default vehicle mass is set to 1750 kg and consists of one front axle and one rear axle, each of which is equipped with two ordered tires. The system supports variant modeling; for example, in the vehicle configuration named "vehicle1_c1," the total vehicle mass can be further increased to 2000 kg, and the front axle can be replaced with a dedicated front axle featuring a steering angle. Meanwhile, specific instances of the front axle, rear axle, and tires can be renamed and managed to meet the requirements of various vehicle configurations. The model requires that the attributes of each component can be explicitly defined, inherited, and overridden, allowing users to flexibly configure various vehicle structures and to provide detailed descriptions and management of specific variants. This supports the needs of different configuration scenarios in actual vehicle design and assembly processes.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package VehicleConfiguration {

    private import ScalarValues::*;

    part def Vehicle {
        attribute mass : Real = 1750.0;
        part frontAxle : Axle;
        part rearAxle : Axle;
    }

    part def Axle {
        attribute mass : Real;
        part tires : Tire[2];
    }

    part def Tire {
        attribute mass : Real;
    }

    part def FrontAxle :> Axle {
        attribute steeringAngle : Real;
    }

    part vehicle1 : Vehicle {
        mass = 2000.0;
        part frontAxle : FrontAxle {
            steeringAngle = 30.0;
        }
        part rearAxle : Axle;
    }

    part vehicle1_c1 : vehicle1 {
        part frontAxle : FrontAxle {
            steeringAngle = 35.0;
        }
        part rearAxle : Axle {
            part tires : Tire {
                :>> tires[1] { mass = 15.0; }
                :>> tires[2] { mass = 15.0; }
            }
        }
    }
}
