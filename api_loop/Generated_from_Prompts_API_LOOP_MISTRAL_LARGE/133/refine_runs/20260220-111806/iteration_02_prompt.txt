You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement a typical automotive Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication and control model, encompassing key components such as the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) and the Engine Control Unit (ECU). Internal vehicle communication is carried out via the CAN bus, with the Vehicle Control Unit and Engine Control Unit each connected to the CAN bus through their respective Bus Interfaces (BusIF). This enables monitoring and control of both vehicle and engine states. Additionally, the system reserves interfaces for sensor data exchange to support future functional expansion. The entire model aims to reflect the physical connections and information flow among the main modules of modern automotive electronic control systems, ensuring reliable and efficient collaboration among vehicle subsystems, and meeting the comprehensive requirements for safety and performance at the vehicle level.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package AutomotiveECUModel {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def CommunicationProtocol {
        enum CAN
    }

    part def VehicleControlUnit;
    part def EngineControlUnit;
    part def CANBus;
    part def BusInterface;

    item def SensorData;

    port def DataPort {
        attribute protocol : CommunicationProtocol = CommunicationProtocol::CAN;
    }

    part vehicle : VehicleControlUnit {
        port busIF : DataPort;
    }

    part engine : EngineControlUnit {
        port busIF : DataPort;
    }

    part canBus : CANBus {
        port vcuPort : DataPort;
        port ecuPort : DataPort;
    }

    part vcuBusIF : BusInterface {
        port internalPort : DataPort;
        port externalPort : DataPort;
    }

    part ecuBusIF : BusInterface {
        port internalPort : DataPort;
        port externalPort : DataPort;
    }

    connect vehicle.busIF to vcuBusIF.internalPort;
    connect vcuBusIF.externalPort to canBus.vcuPort;
    connect engine.busIF to ecuBusIF.internalPort;
    connect ecuBusIF.externalPort to canBus.ecuPort;
}
