You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used to describe a composite system comprising vehicles, engines, and drivers, in which each vehicle possesses attributes such as mass and state. The state of a vehicle includes gear setting and accelerator pedal position. The system provides a specific vehicle instance, "Vehicle_1," which has different attributes at two different time points: at the initial moment, the vehicle mass is 2000 kg, the gear is set to 0, and the accelerator position is 0.0; at the next moment, the vehicle mass changes to 1500 kg, the gear is adjusted to 2, and the accelerator position is adjusted to 0.5. The entire system supports describing the relationships among key vehicle components as well as the evolution of their attributes over time, so as to facilitate modeling and analysis of vehicle operational states.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 2):
                package VehicleSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def GearSetting {
        enum NEUTRAL;
        enum DRIVE;
        enum REVERSE;
        enum PARK;
    }

    part def Engine {
        attribute power : Real;
    }

    part def Driver {
        attribute name : String;
    }

    part def Vehicle {
        attribute mass : Real;
        attribute gear : Integer;
        attribute acceleratorPosition : Real;
        attribute gearState : GearSetting = GearSetting::NEUTRAL;

        part engine : Engine;
        part driver : Driver;
    }

    part Vehicle_1 :> Vehicle {
        mass = 2000.0;
        gear = 0;
        acceleratorPosition = 0.0;
        gearState = GearSetting::NEUTRAL;
    }

    part Vehicle_1_next :> Vehicle {
        mass = 1500.0;
        gear = 2;
        acceleratorPosition = 0.5;
        gearState = GearSetting::DRIVE;
    }
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
