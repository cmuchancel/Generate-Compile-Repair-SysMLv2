You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system is designed to model a vehicle, which possesses certain properties such as mass and current state, including gear position and throttle pedal position. The vehicle also contains an engine as one of its components and can be assigned a driver. Two drivers are defined in the system: Alice and Bob. The vehicle’s attribute values change across different time slices; for example, in the initial state, its mass is 2000 kg, the gear is in neutral, and the throttle is at zero. Subsequently, the mass changes to 1500 kg, the gear shifts to second, and the throttle pedal position becomes 0.5. The system also describes that the vehicle is driven by Alice in the first time slice, and that Bob takes over as the driver in the second time slice. The overall model supports the expression and tracking of dynamic vehicle attributes as well as the process of switching drivers.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
