You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This Vehicle Safety and Anti-theft Function Catalogue is intended to standardize the basic configuration requirements for key vehicle components in terms of safety and anti-theft performance. The vehicle must be equipped with the following safety and security features: At a minimum, basic safety components such as front seat belts and bumpers must be installed on the body and interior to ensure the fundamental personal safety of occupants. Certain components, such as the driver’s airbag and anti-lock braking system, are characterized as safety features but may or may not be mandatory depending on specific configurations. Meanwhile, the vehicle should also be equipped with security components such as an alarm system and a keyless entry system, so as to enhance the overall security and protective capability of the vehicle. The catalogue distinguishes and describes all components that affect safety, all components that affect anti-theft, components that affect both safety and anti-theft, as well as all mandatory safety components, in order to meet regulatory requirements and users’ needs for the most basic safety and protection functions of the vehicle.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
