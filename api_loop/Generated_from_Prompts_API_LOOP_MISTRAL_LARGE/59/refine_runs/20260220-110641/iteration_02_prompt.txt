You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to simulate and compute the dynamic behavior of vehicles during straight-line driving, taking into account influencing factors such as aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. By utilizing the wheel-end output power and the total vehicle mass, the system dynamically calculates the vehicle's acceleration, speed, and position. Given the initial speed and position, as well as a specified time step, and by comprehensively considering parameters such as the aerodynamic drag coefficient and rolling resistance coefficient, the system first determines the available driving power under current conditions, then calculates the vehicle's acceleration accordingly, and further derives the new speed and position of the vehicle at the end of the time step. The system allows users to flexibly set key parameters and can provide accurate physical modeling and computational foundations for applications such as straight-line driving performance analysis, energy consumption simulation, and driving strategy optimization.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
