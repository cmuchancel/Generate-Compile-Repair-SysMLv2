You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement the control logic of an automotive powertrain. Its main functions are as follows: Upon receiving a fuel control command, the system sequentially starts the engine and generates torque according to the predetermined order. The generated torque is then successively amplified, transmitted, and distributed, delivering power stage by stage to the vehicle’s drive wheels to ensure normal driving. When a stall signal is detected, the relevant operational processes will be halted as required. The system supports engine start and shutdown control, as well as the entire power transmission process from fuel commands to actual wheel output torque, ensuring efficient and coordinated power delivery. It provides users with a reliable power response and handling experience.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
