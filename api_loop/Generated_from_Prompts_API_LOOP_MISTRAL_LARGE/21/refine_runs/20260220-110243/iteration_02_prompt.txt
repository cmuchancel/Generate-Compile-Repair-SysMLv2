You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to automate the photography process. Users only need to provide a shooting scene, and the system will first perform focus processing on the scene to generate an image suitable for shooting. It will then convert the image into a photograph through a shooting operation. The entire process is seamlessly integrated, requiring no in-depth user intervention in focusing or shooting details. This simplifies the photography workflow, helping users obtain the final photograph easily and efficiently.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package AutomatedPhotographySystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def FocusState {
        enum UNFOCUSED;
        enum FOCUSING;
        enum FOCUSED;
    }

    enum def ShootingState {
        enum IDLE;
        enum PROCESSING;
        enum COMPLETED;
    }

    part def Scene {
        attribute description : String;
    }

    part def FocusProcessor {
        attribute currentState : FocusState = FocusState::UNFOCUSED;
        port focusInput : Scene;
        port focusOutput : Image;
    }

    part def Shooter {
        attribute currentState : ShootingState = ShootingState::IDLE;
        port shootingInput : Image;
        port shootingOutput : Photograph;
    }

    part def Image;
    part def Photograph;

    part system :> FocusProcessor, Shooter {
        part scene : Scene;
        part focusProcessor : FocusProcessor;
        part shooter : Shooter;
        part finalPhotograph : Photograph;

        connect scene to focusProcessor.focusInput;
        connect focusProcessor.focusOutput to shooter.shootingInput;
        connect shooter.shootingOutput to finalPhotograph;
    }
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
