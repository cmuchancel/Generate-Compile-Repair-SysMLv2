You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to ensure high reliability and safety of the blood glucose meter during use. When the battery is depleted or cannot be charged, the system should be able to automatically detect the battery status and promptly alert the user to prevent failure to measure blood glucose levels due to battery issues, as well as potential treatment delays resulting from such failures. To prevent the aforementioned failure scenarios, the system requires the implementation of preventive measures for battery status, and it must have appropriate alarm and emergency response mechanisms in case of abnormalities in the blood glucose measurement function. Furthermore, the related system requirements have undergone rigorous approval, and management measures have been established for key risk scenarios to ensure that patients can receive timely, continuous, and safe therapeutic support under all circumstances.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
