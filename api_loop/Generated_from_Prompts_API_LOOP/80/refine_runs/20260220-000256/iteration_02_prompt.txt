You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system requires the design of a configurable engine, with a basic structure composed of multiple cylinders. The number of cylinders can be either 4 or 6. Each cylinder is available in two diameters: 70 mm and 100 mm, with the specific selection depending on actual requirements. In terms of engine configurations, the system should support at least two engine variants: a four-cylinder engine and a six-cylinder engine. Users can choose the appropriate combination of cylinder quantity and diameter according to different application scenarios, thereby enabling flexible adjustment of engine performance and size.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

  private import ScalarValues::*;

  enum def CylinderDiameter { d70; d100; }
  enum def CylinderCount { four; six; }

  part def Cylinder {
    attribute diameter : CylinderDiameter;
  }

  part def ConfigurableEngine {
    attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount;
    attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter;
  }

  part def FourCylinderEngine {
    part cyl1 : Cylinder;
    part cyl2 : Cylinder;
    part cyl3 : Cylinder;
    part cyl4 : Cylinder;
    attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount = four;
    attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter;
  }

  part def SixCylinderEngine {
    part cyl1 : Cylinder;
    part cyl2 : Cylinder;
    part cyl3 : Cylinder;
    part cyl4 : Cylinder;
    part cyl5 : Cylinder;
    part cyl6 : Cylinder;
    attribute cylinderCount : CylinderCount = six;
    attribute cylinderDiameter : CylinderDiameter;
  }
