You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system should enable users to obtain photos from real-world scenes. Specifically, after a user selects a scene they wish to capture, the system should first automatically perform focusing for the selected scene and generate an intermediate image. Next, based on the focused image, the system should capture and output the final photo. Ultimately, users can directly obtain photos that meet their requirements from the selected scene, while the system completes the focusing and shooting processes automatically in the background, without requiring manual intervention at each step.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
