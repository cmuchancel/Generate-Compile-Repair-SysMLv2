You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to implement a model of the automobile assembly process, requiring sequential completion of gearbox and engine assembly on the final assembly line. Specifically, the assembly process starts with a vehicle assembly without a gearbox and engine; first, the gearbox is installed onto the vehicle assembly to produce an assembly without an engine, and then the engine is installed onto the vehicle with the gearbox, ultimately forming a fully assembled vehicle. During this process, each assembly step must have clear inputs and outputs, and the fully assembled vehicle should have independent, functional gearbox and engine units, enabling further functionalities such as power delivery. This model focuses on reflecting the sequence of final assembly, the interrelation between assembled components, and the integrity of the complete vehicle after assembly, ensuring the assembly process is standardized, orderly, and efficient, thus meeting the practical requirements of automobile manufacturing and production.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
