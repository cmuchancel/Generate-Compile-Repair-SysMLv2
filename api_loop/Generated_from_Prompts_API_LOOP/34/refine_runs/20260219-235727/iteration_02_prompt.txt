You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to be capable of managing multiple sensors and support monitoring and updating the status of these sensors. When the system detects that any sensor is in a ready state, it should automatically perform an update operation on that sensor. The system should be able to automatically traverse all registered sensors and promptly process and maintain each sensor that meets the ready condition, thereby ensuring that all available sensors are kept up-to-date. This will enhance the overall responsiveness and reliability of the system.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package SensorSystem
{
  private import ScalarValues::*;

  enum def SensorStatus
  {
    enum Ready;
    enum NotReady;
    enum Updating;
  }

  part def Sensor
  {
    attribute status : SensorStatus = NotReady;
    attribute updated : Boolean = false;
  }

  part def SensorManager
  {
    part sensor1 : Sensor;
    part sensor2 : Sensor;
    part sensor3 : Sensor;
    attribute autoUpdateEnabled : Boolean = true;
    attribute autoTraverseEnabled : Boolean = true;
  }

  part system : SensorManager;
}

SYSIDE COMPILER FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS:
            iteration_01.sysml:14:39: error (reference-error): No Feature named 'NotReady' found.
14 |     attribute status : SensorStatus = NotReady;
   |                                       ^^^^^^^^

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
