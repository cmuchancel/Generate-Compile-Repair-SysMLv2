You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to automate the photography process. Users only need to provide a shooting scene, and the system will first perform focus processing on the scene to generate an image suitable for shooting. It will then convert the image into a photograph through a shooting operation. The entire process is seamlessly integrated, requiring no in-depth user intervention in focusing or shooting details. This simplifies the photography workflow, helping users obtain the final photograph easily and efficiently.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package PhotographyAutomation {
  private import ScalarValues::*;

  item def Scene;
  item def FocusedImage;
  item def Photo;

  port def ScenePort {
    item scene : Scene;
  }

  port def FocusedImagePort {
    item image : FocusedImage;
  }

  port def PhotoPort {
    item photo : Photo;
  }

  part def User {
    port sceneOut : ScenePort;
    port photoIn : PhotoPort;
  }

  part def FocusProcessor {
    port sceneIn : ScenePort;
    port imageOut : FocusedImagePort;
  }

  part def ShootingOperator {
    port imageIn : FocusedImagePort;
    port photoOut : PhotoPort;
  }

  part def PhotographySystem {
    port sceneIn : ScenePort;
    port photoOut : PhotoPort;
    part focus : FocusProcessor;
    part shoot : ShootingOperator;
    connect sceneIn to focus.sceneIn;
    connect focus.imageOut to shoot.imageIn;
    connect shoot.photoOut to photoOut;
  }

  part def PhotographyEnvironment {
    part user : User;
    part system : PhotographySystem;
    connect user.sceneOut to system.sceneIn;
    connect system.photoOut to user.photoIn;
  }
}
