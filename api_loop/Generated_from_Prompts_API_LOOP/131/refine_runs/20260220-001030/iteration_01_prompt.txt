You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The vehicle safety and security component system mainly includes the vehicle’s interior and body assembly parts. The interior is equipped with an alarm system, seat belts, front row seats, and a driver’s airbag, while the body assembly comprises the vehicle body, bumper, and keyless entry system. The safety features are primarily reflected in the configuration of seat belts, airbags, and bumpers, which enhance the protection of the driver and passengers during driving. The security features are realized through the installation of an onboard alarm and a keyless entry system, providing support for anti-theft and convenient access for users. The system integrates safety and security functions, aiming to offer users comprehensive safety protection and a convenient user experience.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
