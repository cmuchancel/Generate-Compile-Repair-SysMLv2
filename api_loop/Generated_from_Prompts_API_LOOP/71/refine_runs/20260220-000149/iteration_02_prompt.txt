You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system requires that the actual mass of the vehicle must not exceed the specified limit, with two specific operating conditions: when the fuel tank is full, the total vehicle mass must not exceed 2000 kg; when the fuel tank is empty, the total vehicle mass must not exceed 1500 kg. In both cases, the sum of the vehicle’s curb mass and the fuel mass is considered as the total vehicle mass for calculation purposes. The system also stipulates that the engine must be capable of generating the specified torque characteristics at various speeds, and that the generated torque must be effectively transmitted to the gearbox through the clutch interface to ensure smooth power delivery. The above requirements ensure that vehicle mass control and power transmission comply with design and safety standards.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
