We are already using `vehicleState` in `Snapshot`.\n We are also using `VehicleState` as the type for the state attribute in `Vehicle` (now `currentState`).\n\n We must also check for any other potential issues.\n\n Let's update the model accordingly.\n\n Additionally, we note that the `item def Snapshot` uses attributes that are named similarly to those in `Vehicle` and `Road`.\n This is acceptable.\n\n We will change the `Vehicle` part def:\n\n    attribute currentState : VehicleState;\n\n instead of:\n\n    attribute state : VehicleState;\n\n Let's output the entire model with this change."
