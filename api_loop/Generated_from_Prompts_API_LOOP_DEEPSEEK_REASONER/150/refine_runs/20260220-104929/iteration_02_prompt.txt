You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to implement a typical publish-subscribe message flow architecture, consisting of three main participants: producers, server, and consumers. The system requires that producers can publish topic messages to the server, while consumers can subscribe to specific topics via the server. Upon successful subscription, when a new message related to the topic is published, the server needs to push and deliver the message to all consumers who have subscribed to that topic. The entire process includes consumers sending subscription requests to the server, producers publishing messages to the server, and after receiving the messages, the server sending them to all corresponding subscribers, thus achieving reliable message publishing and distribution and ensuring efficient information exchange between different users.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package PubSubSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def SubscriptionRequest {
        attribute topic : string;
    }

    item def Message {
        attribute topic : string;
        attribute content : string;
    }

    port def PublisherPort;

    port def SubscriberPort;

    port def ServerPort;

    part def Producer {
        port pub : PublisherPort;
        attribute id : string;
    }

    part def Consumer {
        port sub : SubscriberPort;
        attribute id : string;
    }

    part def Server {
        port serverPort : ServerPort;
        attribute subscriptions : string[*];
    }

    part def System {
        part producers : Producer[*];
        part server : Server;
        part consumers : Consumer[*];

        connect producers.pub to server.serverPort;
        connect consumers.sub to server.serverPort;
    }
}
