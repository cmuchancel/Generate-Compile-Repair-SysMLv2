        "reasoning_content": "We are generating a SysML v2 model for a vehicle safety and security component system.\n The requirements describe two main parts: interior and body assembly.\n Interior: alarm system, seat belts, front row seats, driver\u2019s airbag.\n Body assembly: vehicle body, bumper, keyless entry system.\n We are to model this with a conservative subset of SysML v2.\n\n We'll create a package for the system.\n We'll use part definitions for the main components and then compose them in a main part.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Create a package named \"VehicleSafetySecurity\".\n 2. Import ScalarValues (as per the rule: `private import ScalarValues::*;`).\n 3. Define parts for the interior components: AlarmSystem, SeatBelt, FrontRowSeat, DriversAirbag.\n 4. Define parts for the body assembly: VehicleBody, Bumper, KeylessEntrySystem.\n 5. We may also define a main part that composes the interior and body assembly.\n\n However, note that the requirements mention the system integrates safety and security functions.\n We can model the vehicle safety and security system as a part that contains:\n   - interior: which is a composition of the interior parts\n   - bodyAssembly: which is a composition of the body assembly parts.\n\n But note the requirement: \"The vehicle safety and security component system mainly includes the vehicle\u2019s interior and body assembly parts.\"\n\n We can model:\n   part def VehicleSafetySecuritySystem {\n     part interior : Interior;\n     part bodyAssembly : BodyAssembly;\n   }\n\n Then define:\n   part def Interior {\n     part alarm : AlarmSystem;\n     part seatBelt : SeatBelt;\n     part frontRowSeat : FrontRowSeat;\n     part driversAirbag : DriversAirbag;\n   }\n\n   part def BodyAssembly {\n     part vehicleBody : VehicleBody;\n     part bumper : Bumper;\n     part keylessEntry : KeylessEntrySystem;\n   }\n\n But note that the requirements specify the interior and body assembly are the two main parts. We can also model without the intermediate composites if not necessary.\n\n However, the requirements are clear that the system includes interior and body assembly. So we can model the system as having two parts: interior and body assembly.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the system as a single part that contains all the subparts directly, but that would not reflect the grouping.\n\n Let's follow the grouping as per the requirements.\n\n We'll create:\n   - Part definitions for each component (AlarmSystem, SeatBelt, etc.)\n   - Then a part definition for Interior that aggregates the interior parts.\n   - Then a part definition for BodyAssembly that aggregates the body assembly parts.\n   - Then a part definition for VehicleSafetySecuritySystem that has two parts: interior and bodyAssembly.\n\n However, note that the rule says to use minimal structure. We can also model without the intermediate composites and just have the system part contain all the subparts.\n\n But the requirement says: \"The vehicle safety and security component system mainly includes the vehicle\u2019s interior and body assembly parts.\"\n\n Let's model with the two main parts (interior and body assembly) as separate part definitions and then use them in the system.\n\n We are also to avoid complex constructs and use simple declarations.\n\n We'll use:\n   package VehicleSafetySecurity {\n     private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n     part def AlarmSystem;\n     part def SeatBelt;\n     part def FrontRowSeat;\n     part def DriversAirbag;\n     part def VehicleBody;\n     part def Bumper;\n     part def KeylessEntrySystem;\n\n     part def Interior {\n         part alarm : AlarmSystem;\n         part seatBelt : SeatBelt;\n         part frontRowSeat : FrontRowSeat;\n         part driversAirbag : DriversAirbag;\n     }\n\n     part def BodyAssembly {\n         part vehicleBody : VehicleBody;\n         part bumper : Bumper;\n         part keylessEntry : KeylessEntrySystem;\n     }\n\n     part def VehicleSafetySecuritySystem {\n         part interior : Interior;\n         part bodyAssembly : BodyAssembly;\n     }\n   }\n\n However, note that the requirements say the interior is equipped with these parts, so the above seems correct.\n\n But wait: the requirements say \"the interior is equipped with an alarm system, seat belts, front row seats, and a driver\u2019s airbag\". So the alarm system is part of the interior. Similarly, the body assembly comprises the vehicle body, bumper, and keyless entry system.\n\n However, note that the keyless entry system might be considered part of the body assembly, but it's also a security feature. We are following the grouping given.\n\n Let's generate the model accordingly.\n\n We are to output only the SysML text, no prose.\n\n Note: We are not using any attributes, ports, or connections in this simple model. We are only defining the structure.\n\n If the validator requires more, we might need to add some minimal attributes, but the requirements don't specify any.\n\n Since the requirement is to output a model that validates, we'll try to keep it minimal and only structure.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly."
