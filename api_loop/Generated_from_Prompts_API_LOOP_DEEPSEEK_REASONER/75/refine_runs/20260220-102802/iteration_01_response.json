        "reasoning_content": "We are to model a system that checks the curb weight of vehicles against a requirement (<= 2500 kg). The process involves data collection, processing, and evaluation.\n We'll have:\n  1. A part representing the vehicle, with an attribute for its curb weight.\n  2. A part representing the weight checking system, which will have ports for data collection, processing, and evaluation.\n  3. We'll break down the system into parts for data collection, data processing, and evaluation.\n  4. We'll use item definitions for the data that flows between these parts.\n\n Steps:\n  a. Define a package for the model.\n  b. Import ScalarValues for basic types (we'll use Real for weight).\n  c. Define an item definition for the weight data (maybe raw and processed).\n  d. Define an enum for the evaluation result (qualified, unqualified).\n  e. Define part definitions for the vehicle, the weight check system, and its subparts (collector, processor, evaluator).\n  f. Define port definitions for the interactions (to pass data and results).\n  g. Compose the weight check system by connecting the subparts.\n\n Since we are to avoid complex constructs, we'll keep it simple.\n\n Let's structure:\n\n 1. Package: VehicleWeightCheck\n 2. Import ScalarValues::* (for Real)\n 3. Enum def EvaluationResult with members qualified and unqualified.\n 4. Item def WeightData for raw weight (maybe just a Real) and ProcessedWeightData (also Real for now, but could be same).\n    However, note that the requirement says to process the data, so we might have two items. But for simplicity, we can use one item and just pass it through processing.\n    Alternatively, we can have two item definitions: RawWeightData and ProcessedWeightData, both with a value: Real.\n\n    Let's define:\n        item def RawWeightData {\n            attribute value : Real;\n        }\n        item def ProcessedWeightData {\n            attribute value : Real;\n        }\n\n 5. Port definitions:\n    - For data collection: a port that provides raw weight data (maybe from vehicle to collector).\n    - For data processing: a port that takes raw weight data and outputs processed weight data.\n    - For evaluation: a port that takes processed weight data and outputs an EvaluationResult.\n\n 6. Part definitions:\n    - Vehicle: has an attribute curbWeight of type Real, and a port to provide the weight (we'll call it weightPort).\n    - WeightCheckSystem: composed of:\n        * DataCollector: has a port to request/receive raw weight data and a port to output raw weight data.\n        * DataProcessor: has a port to input raw weight data and a port to output processed weight data.\n        * Evaluator: has a port to input processed weight data and a port to output the evaluation result.\n\n 7. We'll then connect:\n    - Vehicle's weightPort to DataCollector's request port (or data port) to get the raw weight.\n    - DataCollector's output to DataProcessor's input.\n    - DataProcessor's output to Evaluator's input.\n    - We might also have a port on the WeightCheckSystem to output the result.\n\n However, note the requirement: The system must have clear steps of data collection, processing, and evaluation.\n\n Let's define the parts and ports step by step.\n\n We are to output only the SysML text. We'll start with the package and imports.\n\n We are to fix validator errors, so we'll use a minimal and robust subset.\n\n Let's write the model."
