You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used to configure the vehicle's powertrain, including the engine and transmission. The vehicle can be equipped with either a four-cylinder engine or a six-cylinder engine, and can be paired with either a manual transmission or an automatic transmission. Each vehicle must select one type of engine and one type of transmission. If the vehicle is a high-performance model, it must be equipped with a six-cylinder engine; otherwise, a four-cylinder engine must be used. In addition, there are only two valid powertrain combinations: either a four-cylinder engine with a manual transmission, or a six-cylinder engine with an automatic transmission. No other combinations are permitted.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
