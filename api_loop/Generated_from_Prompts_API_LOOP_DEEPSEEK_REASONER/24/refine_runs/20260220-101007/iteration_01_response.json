Create a package for the system.\n 2. Define the necessary enums if needed (e.g., for focus quality).\n 3. Define part definitions for the components: maybe a FocusSystem, ImageEvaluator, ShootingSystem, etc.\n 4. Define the ports for interaction between these parts.\n 5. Connect the parts.\n\n However, note that the requirements mention: \"The entire shooting process is automatically linked from scene input to photo output\".\n\n We are to use only the allowed constructs: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def`, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, `connect`.\n\n Let's break down the system:\n\n We have a user who selects a scene. Then the system performs focusing and generates an image. Then evaluates focus. If well-focused, it proceeds to shooting and produces the final photo.\n\n We can model the system as a composition of parts that perform these functions.\n\n We'll create:\n  - A part for the focusing subsystem: `FocusingSystem`\n  - A part for the image evaluation: `ImageEvaluator`\n  - A part for the shooting: `ShootingSystem`\n  - And maybe a controller that orchestrates the workflow: `PhotoCaptureController`\n\n We'll define ports to pass the scene, image, and photo between these parts.\n\n However, note that the system is automated and linked from scene input to photo output.\n\n We can define an item definition for Scene, Image, and Photo.\n\n Steps in the model:\n\n 1. Package and import.\n 2. Define item definitions for Scene, Image, Photo, and maybe FocusQuality.\n 3. Define an enum for FocusQuality: maybe `WELL_FOCUSED` and `NOT_FOCUSED`.\n 4. Define port definitions for the flow of these items.\n 5. Define the part definitions and their ports.\n 6. Define the top-level system part that contains the parts and connects them.\n\n Let's write the model accordingly.\n\n Note: We are to output only the SysML text, no prose.\n\n Let's start."
