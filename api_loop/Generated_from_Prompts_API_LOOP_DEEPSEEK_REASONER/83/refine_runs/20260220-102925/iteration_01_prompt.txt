You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to achieve efficient allocation and management of the powertrain system. The powertrain system consists of a logical layer and a physical layer. In the logical layer, logical components are required to provide power and generate torque, among which the torque generator is responsible for converting power into torque. In the physical layer, there must be corresponding physical components to integrate these functions—for example, the power unit should be capable of both power output and torque generation. The system needs to ensure that the torque generator in the logical layer can be effectively mapped to the corresponding power unit (such as an engine) in the physical layer. Through this mapping relationship, all functional requirements can be accurately realized in the physical hardware, thus ensuring that the vehicle or equipment possesses power transmission and torque output capabilities, and meets the user's core demands for power performance.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
