You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system implements a server that exhibits timed clock behavior. The server features a local clock and a port for receiving requests. After startup, the server initially enters the “off” state and requires a “start” command received through the request port to transition into the waiting state. In the waiting state, the server can receive “request” messages, upon which it switches to the response state. In the response state, the server waits for five minutes before reverting back to the waiting state. Additionally, every day at 11:59:00, the server automatically switches back to the off state. The system supports multiple periodic request and response cycles within a single day and can automatically manage its power state according to the preset schedule, thereby ensuring controllable response timing and orderly service operations.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
