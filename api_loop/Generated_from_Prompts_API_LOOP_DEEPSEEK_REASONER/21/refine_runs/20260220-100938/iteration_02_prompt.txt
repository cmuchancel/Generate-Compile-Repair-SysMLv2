You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to automate the photography process. Users only need to provide a shooting scene, and the system will first perform focus processing on the scene to generate an image suitable for shooting. It will then convert the image into a photograph through a shooting operation. The entire process is seamlessly integrated, requiring no in-depth user intervention in focusing or shooting details. This simplifies the photography workflow, helping users obtain the final photograph easily and efficiently.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package AutomatedPhotographySystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def ShootingScene;

    item def ProcessedImage;

    item def Photograph;

    part def FocusProcessor {
        port input sceneInput : ShootingScene;
        port output imageOutput : ProcessedImage;
    }

    part def Shooter {
        port input imageInput : ProcessedImage;
        port output photoOutput : Photograph;
    }

    part def AutomatedPhotographySystem {
        part focusProcessor : FocusProcessor;
        part shooter : Shooter;

        port systemInput : ShootingScene;
        port systemOutput : Photograph;

        connect systemInput to focusProcessor.sceneInput;
        connect focusProcessor.imageOutput to shooter.imageInput;
        connect shooter.photoOutput to systemOutput;
    }
}
