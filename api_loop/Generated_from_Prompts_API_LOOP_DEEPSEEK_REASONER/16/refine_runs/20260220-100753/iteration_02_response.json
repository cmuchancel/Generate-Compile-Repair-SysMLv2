The keyword `return` is a reserved word in SysML v2, so we cannot use it as a port name without escaping.\n 2. The error at line 23:46 and 23:47 is because of using the reserved word `return` in the connection.\n 3. The error at line 23:38 is because of the chaining with the reserved word.\n\n We need to change the port name `return` to something else that is not a reserved word. We can use a different name, such as `fuelReturnPort` on the FuelTank.\n\n However, note that the Engine already has a port named `fuelReturn`. We can keep that, but change the FuelTank's port to `fuelReturnPort` or similar.\n\n Let's adjust:\n\n In FuelTank:\n   change `port return : FuelPort;` to `port fuelReturnPort : FuelPort;`\n\n Then, in the connection in VehicleFuelManagement:\n   change `connect engine.fuelReturn to fuelTank.return;` to `connect engine.fuelReturn to fuelTank.fuelReturnPort;`\n\n Also, note that the first error at line 10:14 is about the use of `return` as a port name. This change will fix that.\n\n Let's update the model accordingly."
