The error indicates that the enum members are not being recognized correctly.\n Looking at the SysML v2 subset we are allowed, we should use `enum` members inside an `enum def` with the correct syntax.\n\n In the previous attempt, the enum def was written as:\n   enum def EngineType {\n        FOUR_CYLINDER,\n        SIX_CYLINDER\n    }\n\n However, the error suggests that the parser is expecting something else. In SysML v2, the correct way to define an enumeration is to use the `enum` keyword for each member.\n\n Let's change the enum definition to:\n   enum def EngineType {\n        enum FOUR_CYLINDER;\n        enum SIX_CYLINDER;\n    }\n\n This is the correct syntax for defining enumeration members in SysML v2.\n\n Also, note that the previous model had other parts that were valid. We are to preserve valid parts and only make minimal changes to fix the errors.\n\n Additionally, we note that the `part def Engine` uses the EngineType, which we are fixing.\n\n Let's rewrite the model accordingly.\n\n However, note that the feedback also shows an error at line 7: expected a token, and it might be because the enum definition was not correctly closed.\n\n We'll adjust the enum definition and then re-check.\n\n Also, note that the original model had a `private import ScalarValues::*;` which is allowed and we keep it.\n\n We are to output only the updated SysMLv2 model.\n\n Let's write the corrected model."
