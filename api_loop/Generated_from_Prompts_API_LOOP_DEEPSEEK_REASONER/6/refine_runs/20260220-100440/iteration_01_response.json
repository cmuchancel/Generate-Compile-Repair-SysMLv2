        "reasoning_content": "We are given requirements to model an information classification system with two classification schemes: \"traffic light\" (Unclassified, Confidential, Secret) and grade levels (A, B, C, D, F with corresponding points).\n\nWe are to output a SysML v2 model.\n\nWe'll create:\n1. An enumeration for the traffic light levels (Unclassified, Confidential, Secret) with codes and colors.\n2. An enumeration for the grade levels (A, B, C, D, F) with corresponding points.\n\nHowever, note that the requirements say: \"the system must also support grade classification\". We are to clearly define and distinguish the two classifications.\n\nWe are also to create a system that implements an information classification management mechanism. We can think of having a part that represents a piece of information with these classifications.\n\nBut note the rules: we are to use a conservative subset. We are allowed: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def`, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect`.\n\nWe are to avoid `block`, `property`, etc.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nWe can define:\n- An `enum def` for the traffic light classification: `InformationLevel` with members for each level, and then attributes for code and color? But note that in SysML v2, an `enum def` can have attributes? Actually, in the subset we are allowed, we can define an `enum def` with `enum` members. However, we are also allowed `attribute` in other definitions.\n\nAlternatively, we can define two separate enums: one for the level and then have a separate mapping? But note that the requirements say each level has a code and a color. We can model the traffic light as an enum and then have the code and color as attributes of the enum? But in SysML v2, an enum is a data type and each enum member is a value. We cannot have attributes on each enum member in the same way as a class.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a part that represents the traffic light classification and then have attributes for level, code, and color? But then we are not using an enum.\n\nGiven the rules, let's try to use `enum def` for the traffic light and for the grade. We can define:\n\n1. `enum def InformationLevel { unclassified, confidential, secret }`\n   But then we also have to associate a code and a color for each. We can do this by having a part that holds the mapping? Or we can define a separate data type that has the level and the code and color? But that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, we can define the traffic light as a part with attributes:\n   - level: InformationLevel (enum)\n   - code: string\n   - color: string\n\nBut then we have to set the code and color based on the level. We can do that in the part by having constraints? But note we are to avoid constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can define three parts for each level? That would be repetitive.\n\nGiven the requirement to keep it simple and the allowed subset, let's try:\n\nWe can define an `enum def` for the traffic light levels and then in the system, we can have a part that represents the classification and has two attributes: one for the traffic light level and one for the grade.\n\nBut then how do we represent the code and color for the traffic light level? We can have the code and color as attributes of the enum? Actually, in SysML v2, we can define an enum with attributes? Let me check the allowed subset: `enum def` with `enum` members. It doesn't say we can define attributes in the enum.\n\nWe are allowed `attribute` in `part def`. So maybe we can have:\n\n- A `part def` for `InformationClassification` that has:\n   attribute level : InformationLevel;   // enum\n   attribute code : string;\n   attribute color : string;\n\nBut then we have to set the code and color based on the level. We can do that by having a constraint? But we are to avoid constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can have three parts for each level: UnclassifiedInfo, ConfidentialInfo, SecretInfo, each with fixed code and color. But then we lose the enum and it becomes harder to manage.\n\nAlternatively, we can have the code and color as derived from the level? But again, we are avoiding constraints.\n\nGiven the rules, let me think of a simpler way:\n\nWe can define the traffic light as an enum and then in the system, we can have a mapping table (maybe using a part that holds the mapping) but that might be too complex.\n\nAnother idea: We can define the traffic light classification as a part that has a level and then the code and color are set by the level. But without constraints, we cannot enforce that.\n\nMaybe we can break the requirements: the user just needs to be able to set the level and then the system will display the corresponding code and color. That mapping can be done in the implementation, but in the model, we can leave it as an enum and then have the code and color as separate attributes that are set by the user? But then we cannot ensure consistency.\n\nGiven the time, let's try to model the two classifications as enums and then have an information item that has two attributes: one for the traffic light level and one for the grade.\n\nWe can define:\n\n```\npackage InformationClassificationSystem {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    enum def InformationLevel {\n        unclassified,\n        confidential,\n        secret\n    }\n\n    enum def GradeLevel {\n        A,\n        B,\n        C,\n        D,\n        F\n    }\n\n    part def InformationItem {\n        attribute trafficLightLevel : InformationLevel;\n        attribute gradeLevel : GradeLevel;\n    }\n\n    part def InformationManagementSystem {\n        attribute items : InformationItem[1..*];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, the requirements also require the code and color for the traffic light and the points for the grade. We haven't captured that.\n\nWe can add attributes for code and color in the InformationLevel enum? But in SysML v2, we cannot add attributes to an enum in the same way as a part.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a part for each traffic light level that has the code and color as constants? But then we are creating multiple parts.\n\nAnother idea: We can define a part that represents the traffic light classification and then have a level and then the code and color are set by the level. We can do this by having a constraint that sets the code and color based on the level, but we are to avoid constraints.\n\nGiven the rules, we are allowed `attribute` and we can set default values? We can set the code and color in the part for the traffic light classification based on the level by using a constraint? But we are to avoid constraints.\n\nMaybe we can model the traffic light classification as a part that has a level and then the code and color are derived from the level by a mapping that is stored in the system? But then we need a mapping part.\n\nGiven the complexity and the allowed subset, let me try a different approach:\n\nWe can define a part for the traffic light classification that has three attributes: level, code, color. Then we can create three instances of that part for each level. Similarly for the grade, we can have a part for grade classification with level and points, and then create five instances.\n\nBut then the InformationItem would have to reference one of these instances? We can do that by having an attribute that is a reference to a part.\n\nHowever, the rules allow `part` and `connect`, so we can create parts and connect them.\n\nLet me try:\n\nWe'll create a part def for TrafficLightClassification that has level, code, color.\nWe'll create three parts: Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, each with fixed values.\n\nSimilarly, for GradeClassification, we create a part def with level and points, and then create five parts for A, B, C, D, F.\n\nThen, the InformationItem can have a reference to one TrafficLightClassification part and one GradeClassification part.\n\nBut note: the rules say we can use `connect` to connect parts. We can connect the InformationItem to the classification parts.\n\nAlternatively, we can have the InformationItem contain the classification parts? But then we are not connecting, we are composing.\n\nGiven the rules, let me try to model:\n\n```\npackage InformationClassificationSystem {\n    private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n    part def TrafficLightClassification {\n        attribute level : string;\n        attribute code : string;\n        attribute color : string;\n    }\n\n    part Unclassified : TrafficLightClassification {\n        attribute level = \"Unclassified\";\n        attribute code = \"uncl\";\n        attribute color = \"green\";\n    }\n\n    part Confidential : TrafficLightClassification {\n        attribute level = \"Confidential\";\n        attribute code = \"conf\";\n        attribute color = \"yellow\";\n    }\n\n    part Secret : TrafficLightClassification {\n        attribute level = \"Secret\";\n        attribute code = \"secr\";\n        attribute color = \"red\";\n    }\n\n    part def GradeClassification {\n        attribute level : string;\n        attribute points : real;\n    }\n\n    part GradeA : GradeClassification {\n        attribute level = \"A\";\n        attribute points = 4.0;\n    }\n\n    part GradeB : GradeClassification {\n        attribute level = \"B\";\n        attribute points = 3.0;\n    }\n\n    part GradeC : GradeClassification {\n        attribute level = \"C\";\n        attribute points = 2.0;\n    }\n\n    part GradeD : GradeClassification {\n        attribute level = \"D\";\n        attribute points = 1.0;\n    }\n\n    part GradeF : GradeClassification {\n        attribute level = \"F\";\n        attribute points = 0.0;\n    }\n\n    part def InformationItem {\n        attribute trafficLightClassification : TrafficLightClassification;\n        attribute gradeClassification : GradeClassification;\n    }\n\n    part def InformationManagementSystem {\n        attribute items : InformationItem[1..*];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, in the above, we are defining parts for each classification level. Then, when we create an InformationItem, we can set which TrafficLightClassification part and which GradeClassification part it uses.\n\nHowever, we are not connecting the InformationItem to the classification parts. We are just having attributes that are of type TrafficLightClassification and GradeClassification, which are part definitions. We are not specifying which specific part (Unclassified, Confidential, etc.) to use.\n\nWe can change the InformationItem to have attributes that are references to the specific parts? But in SysML, we can use the type of the part and then set the value to a specific part.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `part` keyword to define the classification parts and then in the InformationItem, we can have an attribute that is of type TrafficLightClassification and then set it to one of the parts? But then we are not connecting, we are just setting the attribute to a part.\n\nWe can do:\n\n```\npart def InformationItem {\n    attribute trafficLightLevel : TrafficLightClassification;\n    attribute gradeLevel : GradeClassification;\n}\n```\n\nThen, when we create an instance of InformationItem, we set trafficLightLevel to one of Unclassified, Confidential, or Secret. Similarly for gradeLevel.\n\nBut note: the rules allow `connect`. We can connect the InformationItem to the classification parts? But we don't need a connection if we are setting the attribute.\n\nGiven the time, let me try to output the above model and see if it validates? But note that we are using `real` for points, which is allowed by importing ScalarValues.\n\nWe are also using `string` for level, code, color. We can use the predefined string from ScalarValues.\n\nBut note: the rules say we can use `private import ScalarValues::*;` so we have access to `string`, `real`, etc.\n\nLet me write the model accordingly.\n\nHowever, note that the requirements say: \"the system must also support grade classification\". We are modeling both.\n\nWe are also to have a system that manages information items. We have an InformationManagementSystem that has a collection of InformationItem.\n\nLet me output the model:\n\nNote: We are using `part def` and `part` for the classification levels. We are using `attribute` with default values for the parts.\n\nWe are not using `enum def` because we have extra attributes (code and color for traffic light, points for grade). We are using parts instead.\n\nWe are also not using `block` because it is not in the allowed subset.\n\nWe are using `part` for the classification levels and then the InformationItem has attributes that are of these part definitions.\n\nWe are not using `port` or `connect` because we don't have any interactions between parts that require ports. We are just composing.\n\nLet me write the model accordingly."
