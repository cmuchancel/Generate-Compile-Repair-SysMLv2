        "reasoning_content": "We are to create a SysML v2 model for the described system.\n The system has two types of vehicles: small and large.\n Each vehicle has an engine, and each engine has a number of cylinders.\n Small vehicle engine: 4 cylinders.\n Large vehicle engine: 6 cylinders.\n We are to support engine configurations with 4 to 6 cylinders.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll create a package for the system.\n 2. We'll use `private import ScalarValues::*;` for basic types.\n 3. We'll define an enum for vehicle types? Not explicitly required, but we have two types of vehicles.\n    However, the requirement is about two types of vehicles, so we can create two part definitions for the vehicles.\n    Alternatively, we can have a vehicle with a type attribute. But the requirement says two types, so let's make two part definitions.\n\n 4. We'll define a part definition for Cylinder.\n 5. We'll define a part definition for Engine, which will have a number of cylinders as parts.\n    The number of cylinders will be determined by the vehicle type.\n\n 6. We'll define part definitions for SmallVehicle and LargeVehicle, each having an engine with the specified number of cylinders.\n\n However, note that the requirement says: \"Each type is equipped with an engine, and each engine consists of several cylinders.\"\n Also, the design supports engine configurations with 4 to 6 cylinders.\n\n We can model the engine as having a variable number of cylinders, and then in the vehicle we fix the number.\n\n Alternatively, we can have two engine types: one with 4 cylinders and one with 6. But the requirement says engine configurations from 4 to 6.\n\n Since the requirement is fixed for small (4) and large (6), we can have:\n\n   part def SmallEngine {\n       part cylinders : Cylinder[4];\n   }\n\n   part def LargeEngine {\n       part cylinders : Cylinder[6];\n   }\n\n But then we are not reusing the same engine definition. Alternatively, we can have:\n\n   part def Engine {\n       attribute cylinderCount : Integer;\n       part cylinders : Cylinder[cylinderCount];\n   }\n\n And then in the vehicle, we set the cylinderCount. However, note that the requirement says the engine of a small vehicle has 4 and large has 6.\n\n But the Engine part definition would require cylinderCount to be set. We can set it in the vehicle.\n\n However, the requirement says: \"Each cylinder, as a fundamental component of the engine, plays a key role...\"\n\n We are not required to model the behavior, only the structure.\n\n Let's try:\n\n   part def Cylinder {}\n\n   part def Engine {\n       attribute cylinderCount : Integer;\n       part cylinders : Cylinder[cylinderCount];\n   }\n\n   part def SmallVehicle {\n       part engine : Engine {\n           cylinderCount = 4;\n       }\n   }\n\n   part def LargeVehicle {\n       part engine : Engine {\n           cylinderCount = 6;\n       }\n   }\n\n But note: the requirement says the engine of a small vehicle has 4 cylinders and large has 6. So we are setting the attribute.\n\n However, the validator might not support setting the attribute in the part definition? We can set it in the part usage.\n\n Alternatively, we can define two engine part definitions with fixed cylinder counts.\n\n Given the simplicity, let's go with two engine types.\n\n But the requirement says: \"This design supports engine configurations with 4 to 6 cylinders.\" So we are only using 4 and 6.\n\n Since the requirement is fixed, we can do:\n\n   part def Engine4 {\n       part cylinders : Cylinder[4];\n   }\n\n   part def Engine6 {\n       part cylinders : Cylinder[6];\n   }\n\n Then:\n\n   part def SmallVehicle {\n       part engine : Engine4;\n   }\n\n   part def LargeVehicle {\n       part engine : Engine6;\n   }\n\n However, the requirement says \"each engine consists of several cylinders\", and we are modeling that.\n\n Let's go with this approach.\n\n 7. We'll create a main package and import ScalarValues.\n\n 8. We'll define the parts in the package.\n\n Let's write the SysMLv2 text accordingly.\n\n However, note the rules: we are to use a conservative subset. We are allowed to use `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, etc.\n\n We are to avoid `block` and other constructs.\n\n Let's write:\n\n   package VehicleSystem {\n       private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n       part def Cylinder {\n           // No attributes for now, but we can add if needed.\n       }\n\n       part def Engine4 {\n           part cylinders : Cylinder[4];\n       }\n\n       part def Engine6 {\n           part cylinders : Cylinder[6];\n       }\n\n       part def SmallVehicle {\n           part engine : Engine4;\n       }\n\n       part def LargeVehicle {\n           part engine : Engine6;\n       }\n   }\n\n But wait, the requirement says the engine of a small vehicle has 4 cylinders and large has 6. So this matches.\n\n However, the requirement says \"each engine consists of several cylinders\", and we have that.\n\n We are not required to model the vehicle's power output or the engine's normal operation in detail.\n\n Let's output this.\n\n But note: the requirement says \"Each cylinder, as a fundamental component of the engine, plays a key role...\", but we are not modeling behavior.\n\n We are only modeling structure.\n\n We are using arrays of parts: `Cylinder[4]` means 4 part instances of type Cylinder.\n\n This should be acceptable.\n\n Let's output the model."
