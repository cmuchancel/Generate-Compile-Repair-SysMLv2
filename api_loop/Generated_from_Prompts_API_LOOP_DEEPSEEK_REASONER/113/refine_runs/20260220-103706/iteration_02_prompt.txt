You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to enable automated modeling of vehicle behavior, primarily comprising two core components: the vehicle and the vehicle controller. The vehicle is capable of autonomously managing its operation and health status under different conditions. Normally, the vehicle only initiates the startup process from the shutdown state when both the brake pedal is pressed and a start signal is received; after meeting these requirements, it completes self-inspection and power supply procedures. The system can sense temperature in real time, and when overheating is detected, it automatically sends a warning signal to the vehicle controller, switches the vehicle status to degraded mode, and ensures safety. Health management also includes regular maintenance and fault recovery mechanisms to ensure timely maintenance and restoration from abnormal states to normal. The vehicle controller receives and processes various control and status signals from the vehicle, enabling automatic control operations such as starting and shutting down. The overall system supports configuration of attributes such as fuel, maintenance intervals, and temperature thresholds, thereby achieving intelligent, safe, and efficient management of vehicle operation processes.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package VehicleSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def VehicleStatus {
        Shutdown,
        Starting,
        Running,
        DegradedMode
    }

    item def StartSignal;
    item def WarningSignal;

    port def ControlPort;
    port def StatusPort;

    part def Vehicle {
        port control : ControlPort;
        port status : StatusPort;
        attribute temperature : Real;
        attribute fuel : Real = 100.0;
        attribute maintenanceInterval : Integer = 90;
        attribute overheatThreshold : Real = 120.0;
        attribute status : VehicleStatus = VehicleStatus::Shutdown;
        attribute brakePedalPressed : Boolean = false;
        attribute startSignalReceived : Boolean = false;
    }

    part def VehicleController {
        port control : ControlPort;
        port status : StatusPort;
    }

    part vehicle : Vehicle;
    part controller : VehicleController;

    connect vehicle.control to controller.control;
    connect vehicle.status to controller.status;
}
