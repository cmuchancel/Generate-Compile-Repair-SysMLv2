You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed for automatic monitoring and control of the battery charging process, ensuring that the battery can be safely and efficiently fully charged. The battery charging control system needs to monitor the current battery level in real time, automatically supplying charge when the battery level is below 100%; when the battery level reaches or exceeds 100%, the charging process is automatically terminated without manual intervention. The core functions of this system include battery capacity monitoring, automatic charging, and charging termination control, aiming to ensure healthy charging of the battery and to enhance convenience and safety of use.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 2):
                package BatteryChargingControlSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def ChargingState {
        CHARGING,
        NOT_CHARGING
    }

    part def Battery {
        attribute level : Real = 0.0;
        port batteryPort : BatteryPort;
    }

    part def Charger {
        attribute chargingState : ChargingState = ChargingState::NOT_CHARGING;
        port chargerPort : ChargerPort;
    }

    part def Controller {
        attribute batteryLevel : Real = 0.0;
        attribute desiredState : ChargingState = ChargingState::NOT_CHARGING;
        port batteryPort : BatteryPort;
        port chargerPort : ChargerPort;
    }

    port def BatteryPort {
        attribute level : Real;
    }

    port def ChargerPort {
        attribute chargingState : ChargingState;
    }

    part battery1 : Battery;
    part charger1 : Charger;
    part controller1 : Controller;

    connect controller1.batteryPort to battery1.batteryPort;
    connect controller1.chargerPort to charger1.chargerPort;
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
