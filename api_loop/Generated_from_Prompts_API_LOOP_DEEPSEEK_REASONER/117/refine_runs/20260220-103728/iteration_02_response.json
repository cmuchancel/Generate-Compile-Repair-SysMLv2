The errors indicate that the `enum` members are not being parsed correctly.\n In SysML v2, the correct syntax for an enumeration definition is to use `enum` for the definition and then list the members with `value` or `enum`? \n However, note the feedback: the error says \"Unexpected identifier\" for `enum High`, etc.\n\n Looking at the SysML v2 standard, the correct way to define an enumeration is:\n\n   enum def PerformanceRequirement {\n       value Standard;\n       value High;\n   }\n\n But note that in the previous attempt we used `enum` for each member. The error suggests that the parser is expecting something else.\n\n Let's adjust the enumeration definitions to use `value` for each member.\n\n Also, note that the error for `attribute` in line 38 might be because the previous parsing errors caused the compiler to be in a state where `attribute` is unexpected.\n\n However, let's fix the enumeration definitions first and see if that resolves the other errors.\n\n We'll change:\n\n   enum def PerformanceRequirement {\n        enum Standard\n        enum High\n   }\n\n to:\n\n   enum def PerformanceRequirement {\n        value Standard;\n        value High;\n   }\n\n And similarly for the other enums.\n\n Additionally, note that the feedback says to use a conservative subset. We are already using `enum def` and `part def` etc.\n\n Let's adjust the entire model accordingly.\n\n We'll also note that the original model had a part `wheels : Wheel[4]` which is an array of 4 wheels. That is acceptable.\n\n However, note that the compiler error for `attribute` in line 38 might be due to the previous errors causing the parser to fail.\n\n We'll fix the enums and then re-evaluate.\n\n Also, note that the feedback says to avoid `block` and use `part def` instead, which we are doing.\n\n Let's rewrite the model with the corrected enum syntax."
