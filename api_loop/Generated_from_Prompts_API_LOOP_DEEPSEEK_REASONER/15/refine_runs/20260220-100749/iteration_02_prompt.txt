You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to describe the basic structure and operating principles of a vehicle fuel system. The vehicle is equipped with a fuel tank assembly and an engine, which are connected through fuel lines to facilitate fuel supply and return. The fuel tank assembly is responsible for supplying fuel to the engine, and after combustion and usage, the engine returns the unused portion of the fuel back to the fuel tank. Throughout the entire fuel flow process, the system can monitor and transmit information on the fuel temperature to ensure operational safety and system efficiency. This fuel system design ensures that the vehicle receives a continuous and stable fuel supply during operation, effectively recycles excess fuel, and optimizes resource utilization.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package FuelSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def Fuel {
        attribute temperature : Real;
    }

    port def FuelSupplyPort {
        attribute flow : Fuel;
    }

    port def FuelReturnPort {
        attribute flow : Fuel;
    }

    port def TemperatureDataPort {
        attribute data : Real;
    }

    part def FuelTankAssembly {
        port supplyOutlet : FuelSupplyPort;
        port returnInlet : FuelReturnPort;
        port tempSensor : TemperatureDataPort;
    }

    part def Engine {
        port supplyInlet : FuelSupplyPort;
        port returnOutlet : FuelReturnPort;
    }

    part def Vehicle {
        part fuelTank : FuelTankAssembly;
        part engine : Engine;
        part supplyLine : FuelLine;
        part returnLine : FuelLine;

        connect fuelTank.supplyOutlet to supplyLine.inlet;
        connect supplyLine.outlet to engine.supplyInlet;
        connect engine.returnOutlet to returnLine.inlet;
        connect returnLine.outlet to fuelTank.returnInlet;
        connect fuelTank.tempSensor to vehicleMonitor.tempInput;
    }

    part def FuelLine {
        port inlet : FuelSupplyPort;
        port outlet : FuelSupplyPort;
    }

    part def VehicleMonitor {
        port tempInput : TemperatureDataPort;
    }
