You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used for controlling vehicle start-stop and status management, enabling automated control of vehicle start-up, operation, and shutdown. When the driver prepares to start the vehicle, the system is initially in the off state and enters the start-up process upon receiving the vehicle start signal. If the brake pedal is depressed and a vehicle-on signal is received, the system will send a start control signal to the vehicle controller, allowing the vehicle to formally enter the "started" state. While the vehicle is in the started state, the system will automatically perform a self-check and continuously supply power to the vehicle; when the vehicle needs to be shut down, the system receives a shutdown signal, switches the vehicle state to off, and ensures that the parking brake is applied before shutdown to ensure safety. The entire process ensures that the vehicle can only be started and operated under the correct conditions, and that safety measures are automatically taken during shutdown, effectively improving the convenience and safety of vehicle operation.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
