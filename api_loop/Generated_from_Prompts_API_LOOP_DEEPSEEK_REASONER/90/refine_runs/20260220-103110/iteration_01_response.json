        "reasoning_content": "We are generating a SysML v2 model for systematic risk metadata modeling and management.\n We have requirements to model scenarios, causes, failures, and their relationships.\n We'll use a conservative subset of SysML v2 that is robust with syside.\n\n We are to output only SysML text with no prose or markdown.\n\n We are going to have:\n   - A package for our model.\n   - We'll use `private import ScalarValues::*;` for basic types.\n   - We'll define enums for severity levels and maybe probability ranges.\n   - We'll define parts for Scenario, Cause, Failure, and maybe RiskScenario (which combines multiple).\n\n We are to avoid problematic constructs and use simple declarations.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Create a package named \"RiskMetadataModel\".\n 2. Import ScalarValues.\n 3. Define an enum for SeverityLevel (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).\n 4. Define an enum for Probability (maybe a range or just categories like Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Certain).\n 5. Define a part for Scenario that can have causes and failures.\n 6. Define a part for Cause that has a probability.\n 7. Define a part for Failure that has a severity.\n 8. Define a part for RiskScenario that can group multiple scenarios, causes, and failures.\n\n However, note that we are to describe causal relationships between scenarios. So a scenario might lead to another.\n\n We are to use `part def` and `part` for composition.\n\n We are also to use `port def` and `port` for connections between scenarios to represent causal relationships.\n\n Let's think of the structure:\n\n We can have:\n   - ScenarioDef: a definition of a scenario, which can have multiple causes and failures.\n   - CauseDef: a definition of a cause, which has a probability and can be linked to a scenario.\n   - FailureDef: a definition of a failure, which has a severity and can be linked to a scenario.\n\n But note: The requirement says \"For each scenario, the specific causes and their probabilities of occurrence can be detailed, and possible failure types along with their severity levels can be associated.\"\n\n So, we might have:\n\n   part def ScenarioDef {\n        attribute description : String;\n        part causes : CauseDef[*];\n        part failures : FailureDef[*];\n        // We might want to have ports to connect to other scenarios for causal relationships.\n        port causalInput : CausalLink[0..*];\n        port causalOutput : CausalLink[0..*];\n   }\n\n   part def CauseDef {\n        attribute description : String;\n        attribute probability : ProbabilityEnum; // We'll use an enum for probability categories.\n   }\n\n   part def FailureDef {\n        attribute description : String;\n        attribute severity : SeverityLevelEnum;\n   }\n\n   part def RiskScenarioDef {\n        attribute name : String;\n        part scenarios : ScenarioDef[*];\n        // We might want to connect the scenarios within the risk scenario to show propagation.\n        // But note: the causal relationships are between scenarios, so we can use the same CausalLink.\n        // We can have connections between the causalOutput of one scenario to the causalInput of another.\n   }\n\n   We need a port definition for CausalLink. Since we are only allowed a conservative subset, we can define a port def that is a simple flow.\n\n   However, note: We are to use `connect A to B;` for connections.\n\n   We can define:\n\n        port def CausalLink {\n            // This is a flow port for causal relationships.\n        }\n\n   Then, in the RiskScenarioDef, we can connect the causalOutput of one scenario to the causalInput of another.\n\n   But note: We are to avoid `connect A -> B`, so we use `connect A to B;`.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an item def for the causal link, but the requirement is about causal relationships between scenarios.\n\n   Since we are using ports, we can connect them.\n\n   However, note that the requirement says: \"the system supports the description and tracking of causal relationships between scenarios\"\n\n   So we want to model that one scenario can cause another.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        scenario1.causalOutput -> scenario2.causalInput\n\n   But we are to avoid `->`, so we use `connect scenario1.causalOutput to scenario2.causalInput;`.\n\n   Let's design accordingly.\n\n   We are also to combine a set of interrelated scenarios, causes, and failures to form complete risk scenarios.\n\n   So RiskScenarioDef is a composition of multiple ScenarioDef, CauseDef, and FailureDef.\n\n   However, note that in our design, the causes and failures are already part of the ScenarioDef.\n\n   So we can have:\n\n        part def RiskScenarioDef {\n            attribute name : String;\n            part scenarios : ScenarioDef[*];\n            // We can then connect the scenarios within this part.\n        }\n\n   And then we can define connections between the scenarios' causal ports.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   We are to output only the updated SysMLv2 model.\n\n   We'll start with the package and imports.\n\n   Note: We are to use `private import ScalarValues::*;` for basic types.\n\n   We'll define enums for ProbabilityEnum and SeverityLevelEnum.\n\n   We'll define the port def CausalLink.\n\n   Then define the part defs for CauseDef, FailureDef, ScenarioDef, and RiskScenarioDef.\n\n   We'll use `part` for the composition of causes and failures in ScenarioDef.\n\n   We'll use `port` for the causalInput and causalOutput in ScenarioDef.\n\n   We'll use `connect` in the RiskScenarioDef to connect the scenarios.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: We are to avoid `block` and use `part def` and `part`.\n\n   Also, note that we are to use minimal structure and a single package.\n\n   We are to fix validator errors first. We are using a conservative subset, so we hope to avoid errors.\n\n   Let's write the model."
