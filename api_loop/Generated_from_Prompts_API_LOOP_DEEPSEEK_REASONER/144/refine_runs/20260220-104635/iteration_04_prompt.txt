You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to be able to manage spare parts, personnel, and various related collection types. For spare parts, it should support archiving and management in the form of Bags, with each element in a Bag being a spare part. For integers, the system should support storage in the form of Lists, where each list item is an integer value. For strings, the system should be able to manage strings as Sets. For personnel, the system should support management using OrderedSets, with each element being of the Person type. Additionally, the system should support nested collection management, such as storing a List composed of multiple personnel sets (Set<Person>). For real numbers (Real), the system should allow processing in the form of fixed-length arrays (with a length of 4). All these collection data structures should support integration and interaction with other business functions to facilitate flexible retrieval and use of related information.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 3):
                package CollectionsManagement {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def Person;

    item def SparePart;

    part def CollectionManager {
        attribute spareParts : Bag;
        attribute integerValues : List;
        attribute stringValues : Set;
        attribute personnel : OrderedSet;
        attribute nestedPersonnelSets : List;
        attribute realValues : Real[4];
    }

    part system : CollectionManager;
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
