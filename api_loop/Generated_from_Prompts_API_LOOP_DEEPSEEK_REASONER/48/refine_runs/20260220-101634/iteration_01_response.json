        "reasoning_content": "We are generating a SysML v2 model for the automotive cruise control system described.\n We will use a single package and the conservative subset as instructed.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Define a package for the cruise control system.\n 2. We'll need to represent the following components: CruiseController, CruiseControlInterface, SpeedSensor, Engine.\n 3. We'll define port definitions for the communication of data: set speed, actual speed, fuel control command.\n 4. We'll define part definitions for each component and connect them via ports.\n\n However, note that the requirements mention data ports and the exchange of information such as set speed, speed sensing, and fuel control.\n\n We'll define:\n  - A port definition for setting the target speed (from interface to controller).\n  - A port definition for the speed sensor to send the actual speed (to controller).\n  - A port definition for the controller to send fuel control commands (to engine).\n\n We are to use simple declarations and avoid problematic constructs.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n 1. We have a system that includes:\n    - CruiseControlInterface: where the driver sets the target speed.\n    - SpeedSensor: measures the current speed and sends it to the controller.\n    - CruiseController: receives set speed and actual speed, and sends fuel control commands.\n    - Engine: receives fuel control commands and adjusts the vehicle's power.\n\n 2. We'll need data types for the information exchanged. Since we are to use ScalarValues, we can use Real for speeds and maybe a Real for fuel control command.\n\n 3. We'll define port definitions that specify the type of data they transmit.\n\n 4. Then, we define part definitions for each component and include the appropriate ports.\n\n 5. Finally, we connect the ports.\n\n Since the requirement is to output only the SysML text, we'll write it accordingly.\n\n However, note the instruction: `private import ScalarValues::*` so we can use Real.\n\n Let's structure:\n\n Package: CruiseControlSystem\n   Import ScalarValues\n\n   Define data types (if needed) but since we are using ScalarValues, we can use Real directly.\n\n   We might define an item definition for the data being transmitted, but the requirement says to use simple declarations and we are allowed to use `item def`.\n   Alternatively, we can use `attribute` in port definitions to specify the type of data.\n\n   However, note that the example in the instructions uses `item def` and then `attribute` in port. But we are to keep it minimal.\n\n   Let's define:\n    - SetSpeed: a Real value representing the target speed.\n    - ActualSpeed: a Real value representing the actual speed.\n    - FuelControlCommand: a Real value representing the command to the engine.\n\n   We can define these as item definitions and then use them in port definitions.\n\n   But the instructions say: prefer simple declarations. So we can define:\n\n    item def SetSpeed {\n        attribute value : Real;\n    }\n\n    Similarly for ActualSpeed and FuelControlCommand.\n\n   However, the requirement says to use `item def` and `attribute` and then in ports we can use these item definitions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define port definitions that have an attribute of type Real and skip the item definition. But the requirement example uses item def.\n\n   Let's use item definitions to represent the data.\n\n   Then, define port definitions for each type of data exchange:\n\n    port def SetSpeedPort {\n        attribute setSpeed : SetSpeed;\n    }\n\n    But note: the requirement says to exchange information via data ports. In SysML v2, we can define a port that carries a particular item.\n\n   However, the instructions also allow for `port def` and then in the part definition we can have `port` of that port definition.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n    item def SetSpeed {\n        attribute value : Real;\n    }\n\n    port def SetSpeedPort {\n        attribute data : SetSpeed;\n    }\n\n    Then, in the CruiseControlInterface, we have an output port of type SetSpeedPort.\n    In the CruiseController, we have an input port of type SetSpeedPort.\n\n   Similarly for ActualSpeed and FuelControlCommand.\n\n   But note: the SpeedSensor outputs the actual speed, so it will have an output port of type ActualSpeedPort.\n\n   The Engine receives the fuel control command, so it will have an input port of type FuelControlPort.\n\n   The CruiseController will have:\n      - an input port for set speed (from interface)\n      - an input port for actual speed (from sensor)\n      - an output port for fuel control command (to engine)\n\n   We'll define:\n\n    item def ActualSpeed {\n        attribute value : Real;\n    }\n\n    port def ActualSpeedPort {\n        attribute data : ActualSpeed;\n    }\n\n    item def FuelControlCommand {\n        attribute value : Real;\n    }\n\n    port def FuelControlPort {\n        attribute data : FuelControlCommand;\n    }\n\n   Now, define the part definitions:\n\n    part def CruiseControlInterface {\n        port setSpeedOut : SetSpeedPort; // output\n    }\n\n    part def SpeedSensor {\n        port speedOut : ActualSpeedPort; // output\n    }\n\n    part def CruiseController {\n        port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort; // input\n        port actualSpeedIn : ActualSpeedPort; // input\n        port fuelControlOut : FuelControlPort; // output\n    }\n\n    part def Engine {\n        port fuelControlIn : FuelControlPort; // input\n    }\n\n   Then, in the main system (or package) we create parts and connect them.\n\n   We'll create a part definition for the overall system? The requirement says a single package and minimal structure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define the parts and then in the package we can have a diagram that connects them.\n\n   But note: the instructions say to output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.\n\n   We can define the parts and then in the package we instantiate them and connect.\n\n   However, the requirement says to use `part def` and then `part` for instances.\n\n   Let's define a part definition for the overall system, which contains the parts and their connections.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define the parts in the package and then connect them in the package.\n\n   The instructions say: use a single package and minimal structure.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n    package CruiseControlSystem {\n        private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n        // Item definitions\n        item def SetSpeed {\n            attribute value : Real;\n        }\n\n        item def ActualSpeed {\n            attribute value : Real;\n        }\n\n        item def FuelControlCommand {\n            attribute value : Real;\n        }\n\n        // Port definitions\n        port def SetSpeedPort {\n            attribute data : SetSpeed;\n        }\n\n        port def ActualSpeedPort {\n            attribute data : ActualSpeed;\n        }\n\n        port def FuelControlPort {\n            attribute data : FuelControlCommand;\n        }\n\n        // Part definitions\n        part def CruiseControlInterface {\n            port setSpeedOut : SetSpeedPort; // output\n        }\n\n        part def SpeedSensor {\n            port speedOut : ActualSpeedPort; // output\n        }\n\n        part def CruiseController {\n            port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort; // input\n            port actualSpeedIn : ActualSpeedPort; // input\n            port fuelControlOut : FuelControlPort; // output\n        }\n\n        part def Engine {\n            port fuelControlIn : FuelControlPort; // input\n        }\n\n        // Now, we define the overall system as a part definition that contains instances of these parts and connects them.\n        part def Vehicle {\n            part interface : CruiseControlInterface;\n            part sensor : SpeedSensor;\n            part controller : CruiseController;\n            part engine : Engine;\n\n            // Connect the interface to the controller for set speed\n            connect interface.setSpeedOut to controller.setSpeedIn;\n\n            // Connect the sensor to the controller for actual speed\n            connect sensor.speedOut to controller.actualSpeedIn;\n\n            // Connect the controller to the engine for fuel control\n            connect controller.fuelControlOut to engine.fuelControlIn;\n        }\n    }\n\n   This seems to capture the structure.\n\n   However, note that the requirement says the vehicle obtains real-time speed via the sensor and the controller sends commands to the engine.\n\n   We have connected accordingly.\n\n   Let's output the model."
