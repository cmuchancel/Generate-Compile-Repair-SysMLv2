        "reasoning_content": "We are generating a SysML v2 model for a Vehicle Safety and Anti-theft Function Catalogue.\n The requirements mention:\n   - Basic safety components (minimum: front seat belts and bumpers) are mandatory.\n   - Some safety features (driver\u2019s airbag, anti-lock braking system) may be optional.\n   - Security components (alarm system, keyless entry system) should be included to enhance security.\n   - The catalogue must distinguish and describe:\n        * All components that affect safety.\n        * All components that affect anti-theft.\n        * Components that affect both safety and anti-theft.\n        * All mandatory safety components.\n\n We are to output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.\n\n We are using a conservative subset: package, private import ScalarValues::*, enum def, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, and connect.\n\n We are to avoid problematic constructs and keep a single package with minimal structure.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We have a vehicle that has components. Some components are safety, some are anti-theft, some are both.\n\n We can model the components as part definitions. Then, we can have a vehicle that is composed of these parts.\n\n We also need to capture whether a component is mandatory or optional, and whether it affects safety, anti-theft, or both.\n\n We can use an enumeration to classify the component type (safety, anti-theft, both) and another for mandatory/optional.\n\n However, note that the requirements say that the basic safety components (front seat belts and bumpers) are mandatory.\n Other safety components may be optional.\n\n We can model each component as a part definition and assign attributes to indicate its classification and mandatory status.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an enumeration for the component type and then have a separate attribute for mandatory/optional.\n\n But note: the mandatory status might depend on the configuration (optional for some). We can model mandatory as a boolean attribute.\n\n However, the requirements say: \"basic safety components such as front seat belts and bumpers must be installed\" -> these are mandatory.\n\n We can set an attribute `isMandatory` for each part.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   - An enumeration for the functional area: Safety, AntiTheft, Both.\n   - Each part will have an attribute `functionalArea` of this enumeration.\n   - Each part will have an attribute `isMandatory` of type boolean.\n\n We can then define the vehicle as a part definition that contains parts of these component types.\n\n However, note that the requirements also mention that the vehicle must be equipped with the following safety and security features.\n This suggests that the vehicle must have at least the mandatory components.\n\n We can model the vehicle as having parts that are of the component types, and then in the vehicle we can specify the minimum required.\n\n But the requirements are about a catalogue that standardizes the basic configuration requirements.\n\n We are not modeling a specific vehicle instance but the catalogue of components and their requirements.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the vehicle as a system that must include certain components.\n\n Let's think of the catalogue as a package that defines the component types and the requirements.\n\n We can have:\n\n   - A package for the Vehicle Safety and Anti-theft Function Catalogue.\n   - Inside, we define an enumeration for functional area.\n   - We define part definitions for each component (e.g., FrontSeatBelt, Bumper, DriverAirbag, AntiLockBrakingSystem, AlarmSystem, KeylessEntrySystem).\n   - We set the attributes for each part definition.\n\n We can also have a part definition for the Vehicle that is composed of these parts.\n\n But the requirements do not specify the vehicle structure beyond having these components.\n\n We might not need to model the vehicle as a part with connections. We can just model the components and their properties.\n\n However, the goal is to output a SysML model that validates and satisfies the requirements.\n\n The requirements ask for a catalogue that distinguishes and describes all components that affect safety, anti-theft, both, and mandatory safety.\n\n We can do:\n\n   package VehicleSafetyAndAntiTheftFunctionCatalogue {\n        private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n        enum def FunctionalArea {\n            enum Safety;\n            enum AntiTheft;\n            enum Both;\n        }\n\n        part def Component {\n            attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea;\n            attribute isMandatory : Boolean;\n        }\n\n        Then, for each specific component, we define a part that is a subclass of Component (or we can define each as a part def with these attributes).\n\n Alternatively, we can define each component as a part def and set the attributes accordingly.\n\n Let's define:\n\n        part def FrontSeatBelt {\n            attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = Safety;\n            attribute isMandatory : Boolean = true;\n        }\n\n        Similarly for Bumper.\n\n        For DriverAirbag and AntiLockBrakingSystem, they are safety and optional (so isMandatory=false).\n\n        For AlarmSystem and KeylessEntrySystem, they are AntiTheft and optional? But the requirements say the vehicle should be equipped with them to enhance security. \n        However, it doesn't specify if they are mandatory. We'll assume they are required for security? The requirements say \"should be equipped\", which might not be mandatory.\n        Let's note: the requirements state \"the vehicle must be equipped with the following safety and security features\". Then it lists basic safety components as mandatory, \n        and then says \"certain components... may or may not be mandatory\". Then it says \"the vehicle should also be equipped with security components\".\n\n        We'll interpret that the security components are not mandatory but are recommended. However, for the purpose of the catalogue, we need to list them as components that affect anti-theft.\n\n        We can set isMandatory to false for the security components.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have two categories: mandatory and optional. But the requirements only specify that the basic safety components are mandatory.\n\n        So:\n\n        part def AlarmSystem {\n            attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = AntiTheft;\n            attribute isMandatory : Boolean = false;\n        }\n\n        part def KeylessEntrySystem {\n            attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = AntiTheft;\n            attribute isMandatory : Boolean = false;\n        }\n\n        But note: there might be components that affect both safety and anti-theft. We don't have any in the list, but we can leave the possibility.\n\n        We can also define a part for the vehicle that is composed of these components. However, the requirements don't specify the exact number of each component.\n\n        We can define:\n\n        part def Vehicle {\n            part frontSeatBelts : FrontSeatBelt[2];\n            part bumpers : Bumper[2]; // assuming front and rear\n            part driverAirbag : DriverAirbag[0..1]; // optional\n            part antiLockBrakingSystem : AntiLockBrakingSystem[0..1]; // optional\n            part alarmSystem : AlarmSystem[0..1]; // optional\n            part keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem[0..1]; // optional\n        }\n\n        But note: the requirements are about the catalogue of components, not a specific vehicle design.\n\n        Alternatively, we can just define the components and their properties without composing them into a vehicle.\n\n        However, the requirement says: \"The vehicle must be equipped with the following safety and security features\".\n\n        So we are modeling the vehicle as having these features.\n\n        We'll go with defining the vehicle as a part that contains the components.\n\n        We are to use minimal structure and avoid validation errors.\n\n        Let's try:\n\n        package VehicleSafetyAndAntiTheftFunctionCatalogue {\n            private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n            enum def FunctionalArea {\n                enum Safety;\n                enum AntiTheft;\n                enum Both;\n            }\n\n            // Define the component types\n            part def FrontSeatBelt {\n                attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = Safety;\n                attribute isMandatory : Boolean = true;\n            }\n\n            part def Bumper {\n                attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = Safety;\n                attribute isMandatory : Boolean = true;\n            }\n\n            part def DriverAirbag {\n                attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = Safety;\n                attribute isMandatory : Boolean = false;\n            }\n\n            part def AntiLockBrakingSystem {\n                attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = Safety;\n                attribute isMandatory : Boolean = false;\n            }\n\n            part def AlarmSystem {\n                attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = AntiTheft;\n                attribute isMandatory : Boolean = false;\n            }\n\n            part def KeylessEntrySystem {\n                attribute functionalArea : FunctionalArea = AntiTheft;\n                attribute isMandatory : Boolean = false;\n            }\n\n            // Define the vehicle that uses these components\n            part def Vehicle {\n                part frontSeatBelts : FrontSeatBelt[2];\n                part bumpers : Bumper[2];\n                part driverAirbag : DriverAirbag[0..1];\n                part antiLockBrakingSystem : AntiLockBrakingSystem[0..1];\n                part alarmSystem : AlarmSystem[0..1];\n                part keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem[0..1];\n            }\n        }\n\n        This model defines the components and their attributes, and then the vehicle that is composed of these components.\n\n        However, note that the requirements ask for a catalogue that distinguishes and describes all components that affect safety, anti-theft, both, and mandatory safety.\n\n        We have the attributes that allow us to distinguish.\n\n        But the model does not explicitly list which components are mandatory safety components. We have to infer from the attributes.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define a view that filters by these attributes.\n\n        However, the requirements do not specify that we need to create a view. We are just to model the catalogue.\n\n        This model might be sufficient.\n\n        Let's check the rules: we are using package, private import, enum def, part def, part, attribute. We are not using port def, port, item def, or connect because we don't have interactions.\n\n        We are using multiplicity for the parts in the vehicle.\n\n        We are not using any prohibited constructs.\n\n        We'll output the above.\n\n        However, note that the requirements mention \"basic safety components such as front seat belts and bumpers must be installed on the body and interior\". \n        We have modeled them as parts, but we haven't specified where they are installed. We can add an attribute for location (body, interior) if needed.\n\n        But the requirements only require the catalogue to standardize the basic configuration requirements in terms of safety and anti-theft performance.\n\n        We can add an attribute for location if we want, but it's not explicitly required.\n\n        We'll keep it minimal.\n\n        Let's output the model."
