You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system is designed to describe an automotive configuration space, supporting combinations of different engines and transmission systems. Vehicles can be equipped with either a 4-cylinder or 6-cylinder engine, with each engine type containing the corresponding number of cylinders. Cylinder diameter is a key parameter and can be selected between two specifications: 70mm and 100mm. Each vehicle can only be fitted with one type of engine and one type of transmission system. The transmission can be either a manual or an automatic gearbox. Furthermore, the following constraints apply to concrete configurations: if the engine is a 4-cylinder, a manual transmission must be used; if the engine is a 6-cylinder, an automatic transmission must be used. This model provides users with a clear structure and constraints, enabling the flexible selection of vehicle components and parameters according to actual requirements.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
