        "reasoning_content": "We are given an error in the enum definition. In SysML v2, enum members are defined with the keyword `enum` but note that the error message indicates an unexpected token. \n Let's check the syntax for enum definition in SysML v2. According to the specification, the correct way to define an enum member is by using the `enum` keyword followed by the member name, but note that the error message says it expected one of several tokens, and \"first\" is not one of them.\n\n However, looking at the SysML v2 textual notation documentation, the correct syntax for an enum member is:\n\n     enum <member name> ;\n\n But note that the error message says: expected one of [\"SINLGE_LINE_NOTE\", ...]. This might be because the parser is expecting a different token after the enum keyword.\n\n Let me recall: in the previous iteration, we used:\n\n     enum def GearState {\n         enum neutral;\n         enum first;\n         ...\n     }\n\n The error is at the line for `enum first;`. It's possible that `first` is a reserved word? Actually, it might be because the enum member names must be valid identifiers and not start with a number, but that's not the case.\n\n Alternatively, the issue might be that the enum member names are being parsed as something else. Let's try to change the enum member names to avoid any potential reserved words.\n\n However, note that the error message says \"Unexpected 'first'\". It might be that the parser is not expecting the word 'first' because it is a reserved keyword in some contexts? In SysML v2, `first` is not a reserved word to my knowledge.\n\n Another possibility: the enum member must be defined with a colon? Let me check the SysML v2 textual notation for enums.\n\n After reviewing the SysML v2 textual notation, the correct way is:\n\n     enum def GearState {\n         enum neutral;\n         enum first;\n         ...\n     }\n\n But the error says it expected one of several tokens, and one of them is \"MultiplicityRange\". This might be because the parser is allowing a multiplicity range after the enum keyword? Actually, no.\n\n Alternatively, it might be that the enum member definition in SysML v2 does not use the `enum` keyword for each member, but instead uses a different syntax. Let me double-check.\n\n Actually, the SysML v2 textual notation for enums is:\n\n     enum def GearState {\n         neutral;\n         first;\n         second;\n         ...\n     }\n\n Wait, that might be the case. In the SysML v2 textual notation, the members of an enum are listed without the `enum` keyword. The `enum def` is the definition, and then the members are just listed by their names.\n\n Let me try that.\n\n Also, note that the error message says \"Unexpected 'first'\" and then lists expected tokens. It seems that after the `enum def` and the opening brace, the parser is expecting a member name without the `enum` keyword.\n\n So, let's change the enum definition to:\n\n     enum def GearState {\n         neutral;\n         first;\n         second;\n         third;\n         fourth;\n         fifth;\n         reverse;\n     }\n\n We'll remove the `enum` keyword before each member.\n\n Additionally, note that in the previous attempt, we used `GearState::neutral` and `GearState::second` in the parts. We must adjust the enum member names accordingly.\n\n However, we must also adjust the enum member names in the part definitions. We used `GearState::neutral` and `GearState::second`. With the new enum definition, the members are just `neutral`, `first`, etc., and the usage should be `GearState::neutral` and `GearState::second` (assuming the enum is defined in the same package).\n\n Let's change the enum definition and then adjust the part definitions accordingly.\n\n Also note: the requirements say that at the initial moment the gear is set to 0, and then to 2. We have to map these to our enum. We set 0 to neutral and 2 to second (assuming 2 is second gear). So that part is correct.\n\n Let's update the model accordingly."
