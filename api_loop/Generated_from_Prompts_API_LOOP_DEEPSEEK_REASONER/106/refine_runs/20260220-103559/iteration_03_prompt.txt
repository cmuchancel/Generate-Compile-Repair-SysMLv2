You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system can achieve integrated management of the vehicle powertrain system according to the driver's fuel input command. When the engine start signal is activated, the system first generates the corresponding engine output torque based on the fuel command, then amplifies and transmits the torque sequentially through the transmission, and subsequently distributes the torque to each wheel, thereby achieving effective management and distribution of the vehicle's output power. When the engine shutdown signal is triggered, the relevant power output process is terminated. This entire process ensures that the vehicle performs automatic control accurately and efficiently in terms of power demand response, torque transmission, and power distribution, thereby enhancing the driving experience and improving energy efficiency.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def FuelCommand {

    }
