Create a package named \"VehicleSystem\".\n 2. Import the ScalarValues library for basic types.\n 3. Define an enumeration for the classification (maybe \"Safety\" and \"Security\").\n 4. Define part definitions for each component, with attributes for their classification and whether they are mandatory.\n 5. Compose these parts in a main vehicle part definition.\n\n However, note the requirements: some components are mandatory, some are not.\n\n We are to output only SysML text, no prose.\n\n Let's break down the components:\n\n Safety:\n - Seat belts (2, mandatory)\n - Airbag (1, not mandatory)\n - Bumper (1, mandatory)\n - Anti-lock braking systems (2 sets, not mandatory)\n\n Security:\n - Anti-theft alarm (1, mandatory? The requirement says \"should be installed\", but we'll treat as required for security)\n - Keyless entry system (1, mandatory)\n\n Also, the chassis has two wheels.\n\n We'll create:\n\n part def SeatBelt {\n   attribute classification : Classification = Safety;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = true;\n }\n\n part def Airbag {\n   attribute classification : Classification = Safety;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = false;\n }\n\n part def AntiTheftAlarm {\n   attribute classification : Classification = Security;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = true;\n }\n\n part def Bumper {\n   attribute classification : Classification = Safety;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = true;\n }\n\n part def KeylessEntrySystem {\n   attribute classification : Classification = Security;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = true;\n }\n\n part def Wheel {\n   // No classification given? Probably safety, but the requirement says \"chassis structure is to be fitted with two wheels\"\n   // We'll classify as safety.\n   attribute classification : Classification = Safety;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = true; // implied by \"must be equipped\"\n }\n\n part def AntiLockBrakingSystem {\n   attribute classification : Classification = Safety;\n   attribute mandatory : Boolean = false;\n }\n\n Then, we compose the vehicle:\n\n part def Vehicle {\n   part seatBelt1 : SeatBelt;\n   part seatBelt2 : SeatBelt;\n   part airbag : Airbag;\n   part antiTheftAlarm : AntiTheftAlarm;\n   part bumper : Bumper;\n   part keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem;\n   part wheel1 : Wheel;\n   part wheel2 : Wheel;\n   part antiLockBrakingSystem1 : AntiLockBrakingSystem;\n   part antiLockBrakingSystem2 : AntiLockBrakingSystem;\n }\n\n However, note that the requirement says \"two sets of anti-lock braking systems\", so we have two.\n\n But wait, the requirement also says \"The vehicle interior must be equipped with two seat belts\", so we have two seat belts.\n\n We'll also need an enumeration for Classification:\n\n enum def Classification {\n   enum Safety;\n   enum Security;\n }\n\n Let's write the model accordingly."
