        "reasoning_content": "We are going to create a SysML v2 model for the vehicle feature annotation system.\n The model will include:\n   - A package for the system.\n   - Import of ScalarValues.\n   - Enum definitions for safety and security functions (if needed).\n   - Part definitions for the vehicle and its components.\n   - Attributes for the components to indicate their functions.\n   - Port definitions for interactions (if needed, but given the requirements, we might not need complex ports for now).\n   - Connections between parts (if needed, but the requirement is about distribution and function, so we might not need physical connections).\n\n Since the requirement is to output a minimal structure and avoid complex constructs, we will focus on:\n   - A package for the vehicle system.\n   - Part definitions for the vehicle and its subparts (interior and body assembly, and further breakdown).\n   - Attributes to specify the safety or protection functions.\n\n We note that the requirements mention safety and anti-theft (security and protection) configurations.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n 1. We'll have a top-level part definition for the Vehicle.\n 2. The Vehicle will have two main parts: Interior and BodyAssembly.\n 3. The Interior will have parts: SeatBelts, FrontSeats, DriverAirbag, AlarmSystem.\n 4. The BodyAssembly will have parts: BodyShell, Bumpers, KeylessEntryDevice.\n\n We'll assign attributes to these parts to indicate their function (safety or security).\n\n Alternatively, we could define an enum for the function type and then use an attribute of that enum.\n\n Steps:\n\n a) Define an enum for FunctionType with values: Safety, Security.\n b) For each part, we can have an attribute `function : FunctionType` or maybe multiple attributes if a part has multiple functions.\n\n However, note that the requirement says to specify their respective safety or protection functions.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   enum def FunctionType {\n     enum Safety;\n     enum Security;\n   }\n\n Then, for each part, we can have an attribute `primaryFunction : FunctionType;` or if a part can have both, we might need two attributes.\n\n But from the description:\n   - Seat belts: safety\n   - Driver airbag: safety\n   - Bumpers: safety\n   - Alarm system: security\n   - Keyless entry: security (and convenience)\n\n However, note that the requirement also says \"safety and anti-theft (security and protection)\", so we can use the enum.\n\n We'll keep it simple: each part has one primary function. If a part has multiple, we might need to adjust, but let's assume one.\n\n Alternatively, we can have two boolean attributes: `isSafety : boolean;` and `isSecurity : boolean;` but the enum is clearer for primary function.\n\n However, the requirement says \"specify their respective safety or protection functions\", which might imply that a component can have both.\n\n Let's use two booleans for safety and security, so that a part can be both (e.g., keyless entry might be both security and convenience, but we are only concerned with safety and security).\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   attribute safetyFeatures : string[]; \n   attribute securityFeatures : string[];\n\n But the requirement is to specify for each component. We can do:\n\n   part def SeatBelts {\n     attribute safetyFeature : string = \"seat belt\";\n   }\n\n But that is not typed. Let's stick to the enum and allow multiple by having two attributes of type FunctionType? Actually, we can have an attribute that is an array of FunctionType.\n\n However, the instructions say to use simple declarations. So let's do:\n\n   attribute function : FunctionType;\n\n But then a part can only have one function. We can change to:\n\n   attribute functions : FunctionType[*];\n\n But that might be more complex. Alternatively, we can have two boolean attributes.\n\n Given the conservative subset and simplicity, let's use two boolean attributes:\n\n   attribute isSafety : boolean;\n   attribute isSecurity : boolean;\n\n Then we can set them appropriately.\n\n We'll create:\n\n   package VehicleFeatureAnnotationSystem {\n     private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n     enum def FunctionType {\n       enum Safety;\n       enum Security;\n     }\n\n     // We might not need the enum if we use booleans, but let's keep it for clarity in the model.\n\n     // Alternatively, we can use the enum and then have an array of FunctionType for each part.\n\n     // But let's follow the instructions: simple declarations. We'll use the enum and a single attribute for primary function.\n\n     // However, the requirement says \"safety or protection functions\", and a part might have both. So let's use two booleans.\n\n     // We'll change the plan: remove the enum and use two booleans.\n\n     // Let's define the parts:\n\n     part def Vehicle {\n       part interior : Interior;\n       part body : BodyAssembly;\n     }\n\n     part def Interior {\n       part seatBelts : SeatBelts;\n       part frontSeats : FrontSeats;\n       part driverAirbag : DriverAirbag;\n       part alarmSystem : AlarmSystem;\n     }\n\n     part def BodyAssembly {\n       part bodyShell : BodyShell;\n       part bumpers : Bumpers;\n       part keylessEntryDevice : KeylessEntryDevice;\n     }\n\n     // Now define the leaf parts with attributes.\n\n     part def SeatBelts {\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = true;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = false;\n     }\n\n     part def FrontSeats {\n       // The requirement does not specify function for front seats, but they are part of the interior.\n       // We can set them as safety? Not explicitly, but maybe they are not a safety feature by themselves.\n       // We'll set both to false for now, but note that the requirement only mentions safety and security for specific components.\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = false;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = false;\n     }\n\n     part def DriverAirbag {\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = true;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = false;\n     }\n\n     part def AlarmSystem {\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = false;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = true;\n     }\n\n     part def BodyShell {\n       // The body shell might be considered a safety feature? Not explicitly, but it provides structural integrity.\n       // We'll set both to false for now, unless specified.\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = false;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = false;\n     }\n\n     part def Bumpers {\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = true;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = false;\n     }\n\n     part def KeylessEntryDevice {\n       attribute isSafety : boolean = false;\n       attribute isSecurity : boolean = true;\n     }\n   }\n\n However, note that the requirement says the system must clearly indicate the distribution of these components and specify their functions.\n\n We have the distribution via the part hierarchy, and the functions via the boolean attributes.\n\n We are not using ports or connections because the requirement does not specify interactions.\n\n Let's write the model accordingly.\n\n But note: the requirement says \"output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.\" We must use the constructs allowed.\n\n We are using:\n   package, private import, part def, part, attribute.\n\n We are not using: enum def (because we removed it), port def, item def, etc.\n\n However, we are using boolean which is a ScalarValue, so we import ScalarValues.\n\n Let's write the model."
