You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to simulate and analyze the longitudinal (straight-line) dynamic characteristics of vehicle motion. Users can input vehicle mass parameters, initial position, initial velocity, and a set of segmented power output data. Based on the input power and operating conditions, the system will successively calculate the vehicle’s acceleration, velocity, and position at each moment using dynamic equations with a specified time step. It will then output the sequences of acceleration, velocity variation, and displacement throughout the vehicle's entire motion process. This provides data support and a decision-making basis for applications such as vehicle performance analysis, control strategy development, and driving behavior evaluation.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
