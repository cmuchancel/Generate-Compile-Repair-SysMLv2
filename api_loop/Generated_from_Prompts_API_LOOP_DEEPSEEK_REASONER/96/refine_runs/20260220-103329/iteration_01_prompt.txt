You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to be capable of managing and representing information related to automobiles, with a particular emphasis on parameters associated with vehicle torque values. The system should support the representation of Automobile objects and allow users to refer to automobiles using the alias "Car." It should also facilitate the handling and importing of basic physical quantities such as torque values (TorqueValue), and support the use of "Torque" as an alias for torque value. Furthermore, the system should be able to flexibly import and manage various scalar physical quantity data to meet the requirements of automobile-related data processing and modeling.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
