        "reasoning_content": "We are given requirements to model a vehicle safety and security system in SysML v2.\n We'll create a package for the vehicle system. We'll use part definitions for the vehicle and its components.\n We are to distinguish between mandatory and optional safety features, and also include security devices.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll create a package for the model.\n 2. We'll define an enumeration for the feature type (safety or security) and another for mandatory vs optional?\n    However, note that the requirement says: seat belts and bumpers are mandatory safety features, while airbags and anti-lock braking systems are optional safety features.\n    We can model this by having a boolean attribute `isMandatory` in the safety features? Or we can have an enumeration for safety feature type (mandatory, optional).\n    Alternatively, we can have two separate part definitions for mandatory safety features and optional safety features, but that might not be flexible.\n\n 3. We are to filter and organize components based on safety or security features, and visualize them. This might be out of scope for the model structure itself, but we can model the components and their categorization.\n\n 4. We are to use a conservative subset: package, private import ScalarValues, enum def, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, connect.\n\n 5. We are to avoid complex constructs.\n\n Let's design:\n\n We'll have:\n   - A package for the vehicle system.\n   - We'll define an enumeration for `FeatureCategory` with values `Safety` and `Security`.\n   - We can define another enumeration for `SafetyRequirement` with values `Mandatory` and `Optional` to categorize safety features.\n\n Alternatively, we can have:\n   - A base `Feature` which has a category and for safety, a requirement level.\n\n However, note that the requirements specify that security devices are not categorized as mandatory/optional in the same way.\n\n Let's break down the components:\n\n   Safety Features (with requirement level):\n      Seat belts (mandatory)\n      Bumpers (mandatory)\n      Airbags (optional)\n      Anti-lock braking systems (optional)\n\n   Security Devices:\n      Alarms\n      Keyless entry systems\n\n We can model each component as a part definition. We can then have a Vehicle that is composed of these parts.\n\n We'll create:\n\n   enum def FeatureCategory {\n     enum Safety,\n     enum Security\n   }\n\n   enum def SafetyRequirement {\n     enum Mandatory,\n     enum Optional\n   }\n\n Then, we can define a base `VehicleComponent` that has:\n   - attribute category : FeatureCategory;\n   - For safety components, we can have an optional attribute `safetyRequirement : SafetyRequirement;` (only for safety)\n\n But note: the requirement says to clearly distinguish between mandatory and non-mandatory safety functions.\n\n Alternatively, we can have two subcategories of safety features: `MandatorySafetyFeature` and `OptionalSafetyFeature` as part definitions, but that might be less flexible.\n\n Let's go with:\n\n   part def VehicleComponent {\n     attribute category : FeatureCategory;\n   }\n\n   Then, for safety components, we can have:\n\n   part def SafetyComponent {\n     attribute requirement : SafetyRequirement;\n   }\n\n   And then, we can have specific components that are a type of SafetyComponent or a type of VehicleComponent (for security).\n\n However, note that we are to use part definitions and parts. We can use inheritance? But the rules don't mention `specialization`. We are allowed to use `part def` and `part` and `attribute`.\n\n Alternatively, we can model each component as a part definition and then assign attributes to categorize.\n\n We are to output only SysML text, so let's try to be simple.\n\n We can do:\n\n   part def SeatBelt {\n     attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Safety;\n     attribute requirement : SafetyRequirement = SafetyRequirement::Mandatory;\n   }\n\n   Similarly for others.\n\n But note: the requirement says the system is capable of filtering and organizing all vehicle-related components based on safety or security features.\n\n We can also have a `Vehicle` part that contains parts of these components.\n\n Let's design the Vehicle:\n\n   part def Vehicle {\n     part seatBelt : SeatBelt;\n     part bumper : Bumper;\n     part airbag : Airbag;\n     part antiLockBraking : AntiLockBraking;\n     part alarm : Alarm;\n     part keylessEntry : KeylessEntry;\n   }\n\n We'll define each component as a part def.\n\n However, note that the requirement says \"the vehicle includes components such as ...\", so we are to model the vehicle as having these parts.\n\n Let's create the model step by step.\n\n We'll start with the package and import ScalarValues.\n\n Then, define the enumerations.\n\n Then, define the part definitions for each component.\n\n Then, define the Vehicle part definition that contains these parts.\n\n We are also to visualize in tree structures or tables, but that might be beyond the model text. We'll just structure the model.\n\n Let's write the code:\n\n Note: We are to output only the SysML model text."
