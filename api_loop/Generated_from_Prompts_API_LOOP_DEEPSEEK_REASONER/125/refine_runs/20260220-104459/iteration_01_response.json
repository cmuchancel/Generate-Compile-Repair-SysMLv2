        "reasoning_content": "We are going to create a SysML v2 model for the described vehicle safety and security system.\n We'll have a package for the system and define enums, parts, and attributes as needed.\n We are to manage and display vehicle safety and security features.\n The vehicle includes components: seat belts, airbags, alarm devices, bumpers, anti-lock braking systems, keyless entry systems.\n Among these, seat belts and bumpers are mandatory safety features, while airbags and anti-lock braking systems are optional safety features.\n Security devices: alarms and keyless entry systems.\n\n We'll create:\n   - An enum for feature type (safety or security) and another for mandatory/optional if needed.\n   - Part definitions for the vehicle and its components.\n   - Attributes to categorize the components (safety/security, mandatory/optional).\n\n However, note that the requirement says to use a conservative subset and avoid certain constructs.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We'll have a package named \"VehicleSafetySecurity\".\n\n We can define an enum for the feature category: Safety, Security.\n We can define an enum for the requirement type: Mandatory, Optional.\n\n But note: the requirements say that for safety, some are mandatory and some optional. For security, we are not told about mandatory/optional.\n\n Alternatively, we can have:\n   - A part definition for the Vehicle, which contains parts for each component.\n   - Each component (seat belt, airbag, etc.) can be a part definition with attributes for category and requirement type.\n\n However, the requirement says to use `enum def` with `enum` members, and then `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, etc.\n\n We are also to visualize in tree structures or tables, but we are only modeling the structure.\n\n Let's design:\n\n 1. Define an enum for FeatureCategory: Safety, Security.\n 2. Define an enum for SafetyRequirement: Mandatory, Optional. (Note: this might only apply to safety features, so we can have it as an attribute for safety components, and leave it undefined for security if not needed.)\n\n 3. Define part definitions for each component type (e.g., SeatBelt, Airbag, etc.) with attributes for category and requirement (if applicable).\n\n 4. Define a part definition for the Vehicle that contains parts of these components.\n\n However, note that the requirement says to filter and organize based on safety or security features. So we need to be able to categorize each component.\n\n Alternatively, we can have a general \"VehicleComponent\" part definition and then specialize for each specific component? But the requirement says to use a conservative subset, so we might avoid generalization.\n\n Since we are to output a simple model, we can define each component as a part definition and then in the Vehicle, include them as parts.\n\n Let's list the components and their properties:\n\n   - SeatBelt: category = Safety, requirement = Mandatory\n   - Bumper: category = Safety, requirement = Mandatory\n   - Airbag: category = Safety, requirement = Optional\n   - AntiLockBrakingSystem: category = Safety, requirement = Optional\n   - Alarm: category = Security\n   - KeylessEntrySystem: category = Security\n\n We are not told about requirement for security, so we can leave it out or set it to null? We can make the requirement attribute optional.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Create the package.\n 2. Import ScalarValues (as per the rules).\n 3. Define enums: FeatureCategory, SafetyRequirement.\n 4. Define part definitions for each component with attributes for category and requirement (where applicable).\n 5. Define the Vehicle part that contains these components as parts.\n\n However, note that the requirement says to use `part` and `attribute` and `port def` if needed, but we don't have interaction between parts in the description, so we can skip ports and connections.\n\n Let's write the code:\n\n We are going to have:\n\n   package VehicleSafetySecurity {\n        private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n        enum def FeatureCategory {\n            enum Safety,\n            enum Security\n        }\n\n        enum def SafetyRequirement {\n            enum Mandatory,\n            enum Optional\n        }\n\n        part def SeatBelt {\n            attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Safety;\n            attribute requirement : SafetyRequirement = SafetyRequirement::Mandatory;\n        }\n\n        part def Bumper {\n            attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Safety;\n            attribute requirement : SafetyRequirement = SafetyRequirement::Mandatory;\n        }\n\n        part def Airbag {\n            attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Safety;\n            attribute requirement : SafetyRequirement = SafetyRequirement::Optional;\n        }\n\n        part def AntiLockBrakingSystem {\n            attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Safety;\n            attribute requirement : SafetyRequirement = SafetyRequirement::Optional;\n        }\n\n        part def Alarm {\n            attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Security;\n            // No requirement attribute for security? We can leave it out or set it to null.\n            // But note: the attribute is defined in the part def, so we must set it. We can make it optional by not setting a default and then not assigning in the part?\n            // Alternatively, we can have a separate attribute for security requirement? Not specified.\n            // Let's not include requirement for security components in the model because it's not mentioned.\n        }\n\n        part def KeylessEntrySystem {\n            attribute category : FeatureCategory = FeatureCategory::Security;\n        }\n\n        part def Vehicle {\n            part seatBelt : SeatBelt;\n            part bumper : Bumper;\n            part airbag : Airbag;\n            part antiLockBrakingSystem : AntiLockBrakingSystem;\n            part alarm : Alarm;\n            part keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem;\n        }\n   }\n\n However, note that the Alarm and KeylessEntrySystem do not have the requirement attribute. This is acceptable because the requirement was only for safety.\n\n But wait, the requirement says to clearly distinguish between mandatory and non-mandatory safety functions. So we are good.\n\n However, note that the requirement says to use `item def` if needed. We don't have any items in the description.\n\n Also, we are not using ports or connections because there's no interaction described.\n\n Let's output the above.\n\n But note: the validator might require that we use `attribute` for the category and requirement in the parts of the Vehicle? No, the parts themselves have these attributes.\n\n We are not using any constraints or operations.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly."
