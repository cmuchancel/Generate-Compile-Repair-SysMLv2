We'll create a package for the system.\n 2. We'll use private import for ScalarValues.\n 3. We can define an enum if needed, but the requirements don't specify, so we might skip or use a simple one for demonstration.\n 4. We'll define a top-level system part that decomposes into subsystems and components.\n 5. We'll define port definitions and ports to specify interfaces.\n 6. We'll use connections to connect the parts through their ports.\n\n Since the requirements are about structural decomposition and interfaces, we'll create:\n   - A top-level system (e.g., \"Spacecraft\") that is composed of subsystems (e.g., \"PowerSystem\", \"CommunicationSystem\").\n   - Each subsystem may be further decomposed into components (e.g., \"Battery\", \"SolarPanel\" for the power system).\n   - We'll define port definitions for the interfaces (e.g., \"PowerInterface\", \"DataInterface\").\n   - We'll define the parts and connect them.\n\n Let's outline the model:\n\n Package: StructuralDecompositionExample\n\n We'll define:\n   - A port definition for power (with an attribute for voltage, for example) and one for data (with an attribute for data rate).\n   - Then, we'll define part definitions for the system, subsystems, and components.\n\n However, note that we are to use a conservative subset and avoid complex constructs.\n\n Let's create:\n\n 1. Import ScalarValues.\n 2. Define an enum for power state (optional, but to show enum usage).\n 3. Define port definitions for PowerPort and DataPort.\n 4. Define part definitions for the components (e.g., Battery, SolarPanel, Transmitter, Receiver).\n 5. Define part definitions for the subsystems (e.g., PowerSystem, CommunicationSystem) that are composed of the components.\n 6. Define the top-level system (e.g., Spacecraft) composed of the subsystems.\n 7. Define the parts and connections in the top-level part.\n\n We'll keep attributes simple.\n\n Let's write the SysML v2 text accordingly.\n\n Note: We are to output only the SysML text with no prose or markdown.\n\n Let's generate the model step by step."
