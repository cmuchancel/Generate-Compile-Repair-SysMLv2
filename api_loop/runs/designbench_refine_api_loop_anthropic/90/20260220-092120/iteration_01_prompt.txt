You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed for systematic risk metadata modeling and management across various scenarios, causes, and failures. Users can identify and describe different scenarios that may occur within the system. For each scenario, the specific causes and their probabilities of occurrence can be detailed, and possible failure types along with their severity levels can be associated. Furthermore, the system supports the description and tracking of causal relationships between scenarios, facilitating the understanding and analysis of risk propagation chains. On this basis, users can also combine a set of interrelated scenarios, causes, and failures to form complete risk scenarios, supporting risk analysis and decision-making. The system metadata is compatible with standard modeling languages, making it easy to integrate into larger systems engineering environments and enhancing the systematic capabilities of risk identification, analysis, and management.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
