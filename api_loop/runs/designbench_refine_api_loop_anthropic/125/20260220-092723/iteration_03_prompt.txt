You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to manage and display vehicle safety and security-related features and components, ensuring that users can intuitively understand the safety and security configurations of the entire vehicle and its constituent parts. The vehicle includes components such as seat belts, airbags, and alarm devices. Among these, seat belts and bumpers are mandatory safety features, while airbags and anti-lock braking systems are optional safety features. Additionally, the vehicle is equipped with security devices such as alarms and keyless entry systems. The system is capable of filtering and organizing all vehicle-related components based on safety or security features, and visualizing them in forms such as tree structures or tables. This enables end users to quickly review the safety configurations of the whole vehicle and its sub-systems, clearly distinguishing between mandatory and non-mandatory safety functions, thereby achieving comprehensive management and transparent display of the vehicle’s safety and security features.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
