You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement a dynamic connection reference model between a vehicle and a towed trailer. The vehicle section comprises a chassis equipped with a tow ball device; the trailer section includes a trailer chassis and a coupler mechanism. The coupler mechanism is able to engage or disengage with the tow ball through its internal structure. Users should be able to connect and disconnect the trailer to and from the vehicle (i.e., hitching and unhitching operations). When connected, the trailer’s coupler should securely latch onto the vehicle’s tow ball, while disconnection should allow the two to separate smoothly, thereby achieving safe and convenient trailer attachment and detachment functionality.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
