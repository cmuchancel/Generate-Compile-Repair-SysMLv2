You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The traffic signal system includes a traffic signal component that represents the current color state of the traffic light, with the colors being green, yellow, and red. Additionally, the system defines a specific traffic signal component that is in the green state, indicating that it is always in the "go" state. The above model supports the explicit indication of the traffic light's color, helping to facilitate orderly traffic flow and management.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
