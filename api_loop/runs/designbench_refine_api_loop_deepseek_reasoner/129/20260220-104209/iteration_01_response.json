        "reasoning_content": "We are given requirements to model a Vehicle Safety and Anti-theft Function Catalogue in SysML v2.\n We are to focus on a conservative subset: package, private import ScalarValues::*, enum def, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, and connect.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll create a package for the vehicle safety and anti-theft catalogue.\n 2. We'll use an enum def for component types or categories (if needed).\n 3. We'll define part definitions for the vehicle and its components.\n 4. We'll use attributes to characterize the components (e.g., mandatory or optional).\n 5. We'll use ports and connections if necessary to show relationships, but the problem is more about classification.\n\n However, note: The requirements mention components that are safety, anti-theft, or both, and mandatory vs. optional.\n\n We can structure by:\n  - Having a part definition for the vehicle that contains parts for each component.\n  - Each component may have an attribute to indicate its category (safety, anti-theft, both) and whether it is mandatory.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an enumeration for the category and one for mandatory/optional.\n\n Let's plan:\n\n 1. Create an enum for component category: Safety, AntiTheft, Both.\n 2. Create an enum for requirement level: Mandatory, Optional.\n\n 3. Define a part definition for the vehicle that has parts for each component.\n\n 4. For each component, we can define a part definition with attributes for category and requirement level.\n\n But note: the requirements list specific components: front seat belts, bumpers, driver\u2019s airbag, anti-lock braking system, alarm system, keyless entry system.\n\n We can model:\n\n  - Vehicle\n      - has parts: FrontSeatBelt, Bumper, DriverAirbag, AntiLockBrakingSystem, AlarmSystem, KeylessEntrySystem.\n\n 5. We'll assign each component a category and requirement level.\n\n However, note that the requirement says:\n    - Basic safety components (front seat belts and bumpers) are mandatory.\n    - Driver\u2019s airbag and anti-lock braking system are safety features that may or may not be mandatory.\n    - Alarm system and keyless entry system are security components.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n  - FrontSeatBelt: safety, mandatory.\n  - Bumper: safety, mandatory.\n  - DriverAirbag: safety, optional (depending on configuration).\n  - AntiLockBrakingSystem: safety, optional (depending on configuration).\n  - AlarmSystem: anti-theft, optional? (the requirement says the vehicle should be equipped, but it doesn't specify mandatory for basic, so we assume optional? But note: the catalogue standardizes basic configuration requirements. We'll have to see.)\n\n Actually, the requirement says: \"the vehicle must be equipped with the following safety and security features: ... basic safety components ... must be installed ... certain components ... may or may not be mandatory ... the vehicle should also be equipped with security components ...\"\n\n We interpret:\n    - Safety: basic (mandatory) and advanced (optional).\n    - Security: all are optional? But the requirement says \"should\", so we can treat them as optional.\n\n Let's define:\n\n  - AlarmSystem: anti-theft, optional.\n  - KeylessEntrySystem: anti-theft, optional.\n\n But note: the requirement says \"to enhance the overall security\", so they are not mandatory for the most basic.\n\n 6. We can create a part definition for each component and then set their attributes accordingly.\n\n 7. We might want to have a way to group components by category and by requirement.\n\n However, the requirement says to output a SysML v2 model that validates. We are to use a conservative subset.\n\n Let's create:\n\n  - A package for the catalogue.\n  - Import ScalarValues (as per the rule).\n  - Define enums for Category and RequirementLevel.\n  - Define a part definition for each component type, and then a part for each in the vehicle.\n\n But note: the vehicle is a part def that contains parts of these component types.\n\n Alternatively, we can define a general Component part def with attributes, and then specialize for each? However, the rule says to keep it simple.\n\n Let's do:\n\n  package VehicleSafetyAntiTheftCatalogue {\n      private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n      enum def Category {\n          enum Safety,\n          enum AntiTheft,\n          enum Both\n      }\n\n      enum def RequirementLevel {\n          enum Mandatory,\n          enum Optional\n      }\n\n      part def Component {\n          attribute category : Category;\n          attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel;\n      }\n\n      part def Vehicle {\n          part frontSeatBelt : Component;\n          part bumper : Component;\n          part driverAirbag : Component;\n          part antiLockBrakingSystem : Component;\n          part alarmSystem : Component;\n          part keylessEntrySystem : Component;\n      }\n  }\n\n Then we need to set the values for each component in the Vehicle.\n\n However, note that each component in the vehicle is a part of type Component, but we want to set the attributes for each.\n\n We can set them in the Vehicle part definition by using attribute assignments? But in SysML v2, we can set the values of the attributes of the parts in the containing part.\n\n Alternatively, we can define specific part definitions for each component that extend Component and set the attributes. Then use those in Vehicle.\n\n Let's do:\n\n  part def FrontSeatBelt :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::Safety;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Mandatory;\n  }\n\n  Similarly for others.\n\n Then in Vehicle:\n\n      part frontSeatBelt : FrontSeatBelt;\n\n But note: the requirement says \"basic safety components such as front seat belts and bumpers must be installed\". So we can set them as mandatory.\n\n However, the requirement also says \"certain components, such as the driver\u2019s airbag and anti-lock braking system, are characterized as safety features but may or may not be mandatory\". We set them as optional.\n\n Let's create:\n\n  part def FrontSeatBelt, Bumper, DriverAirbag, AntiLockBrakingSystem, AlarmSystem, KeylessEntrySystem as specializations of Component.\n\n Then set their attributes.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid creating separate part defs for each and set the attributes in the Vehicle part by using an initial value? But note that the rule says we can use `attribute name : Type = Value;` for attributes.\n\n However, for parts we are using `part name : Type;` and then we can set the attributes of that part in the context of the containing part? But in the conservative subset, we might not be able to set the part's attributes from the container.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the attributes in the part definition and then use that part definition.\n\n Let's go with:\n\n  part def FrontSeatBelt :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::Safety;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Mandatory;\n  }\n\n  part def Bumper :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::Safety;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Mandatory;\n  }\n\n  part def DriverAirbag :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::Safety;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Optional;\n  }\n\n  part def AntiLockBrakingSystem :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::Safety;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Optional;\n  }\n\n  part def AlarmSystem :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::AntiTheft;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Optional;\n  }\n\n  part def KeylessEntrySystem :> Component {\n      attribute category : Category = Category::AntiTheft;\n      attribute requirementLevel : RequirementLevel = RequirementLevel::Optional;\n  }\n\n  Then in Vehicle:\n\n      part frontSeatBelt : FrontSeatBelt;\n      part bumper : Bumper;\n      part driverAirbag : DriverAirbag;\n      part antiLockBrakingSystem : AntiLockBrakingSystem;\n      part alarmSystem : AlarmSystem;\n      part keylessEntrySystem : KeylessEntrySystem;\n\n But note: the requirement also mentions components that affect both safety and anti-theft. We don't have any in the list, but we have the category for it.\n\n We'll leave the enum and the structure for future extension.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the requirement says to output a SysML v2 model that validates. We are to use a conservative subset.\n\n We are using:\n   - package\n   - private import\n   - enum def\n   - part def\n   - part\n   - attribute\n\n We are not using ports, connections, item def, etc., because the requirement doesn't specify interactions.\n\n Let's write the code."
