        "reasoning_content": "We are to create a SysML v2 model for vehicle driving dynamics simulation.\n Requirements: model vehicle mass, wheel power, aerodynamic drag coefficient, rolling resistance coefficient, initial speed and position.\n The system should calculate speed and position at each time step, accounting for air resistance and friction.\n\n We are to output a SysML v2 model using a conservative subset: package, private import, enum def, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, and connect.\n\n We are to avoid complex constructs that fail validation.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n 1. We need a package for the model.\n 2. We might need an import for ScalarValues (for real numbers, etc.).\n 3. We need to define the vehicle as a part with attributes for mass, wheel power, drag coefficient, rolling resistance, speed, position, etc.\n 4. We might need to define a port for the vehicle to interact with the environment (like road, air) but the requirement is about dynamics without explicit environment parts.\n 5. The requirement says to compute at each time step. We might need a time step attribute and a way to update. However, SysMLv2 does not have built-in simulation. We can only model the structure and the attributes that would be used in simulation.\n\n Since we are to avoid operations and state machines, we will model the attributes and leave the simulation to an external tool.\n\n However, the requirement says to \"automatically calculate and update\". We are limited by the subset. We can only define the attributes and their relationships via constraints if necessary. But note: we are to avoid constraints (pseudo-code constraints are discouraged).\n\n Let's think of the minimal structure:\n\n We can have:\n   - A part definition for the vehicle with attributes for the parameters and the state.\n\n We also note that the system is to compute based on user input. We might need an input and output. But without operations, we can only model the data.\n\n Given the constraints, we model the vehicle with:\n\n   - Parameters: mass, wheelPower, dragCoefficient, rollingResistanceCoefficient\n   - Initial state: initialSpeed, initialPosition\n   - Current state: speed, position, acceleration (maybe)\n\n We are to compute over time. We can have a time step and maybe a way to represent the simulation time. But note: the requirement says \"at each time step\". We might model a time attribute and then the state at that time.\n\n However, without behavior, we can only model the structure.\n\n Let's create:\n\n   package VehicleDynamicsModel\n\n   import ScalarValues::* (for Real)\n\n   part def Vehicle {\n        // Parameters\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute wheelPower : Real;\n        attribute dragCoefficient : Real;\n        attribute rollingResistanceCoefficient : Real;\n\n        // Initial conditions\n        attribute initialSpeed : Real;\n        attribute initialPosition : Real;\n\n        // Current state (to be updated by simulation)\n        attribute currentSpeed : Real;\n        attribute currentPosition : Real;\n        attribute currentAcceleration : Real;\n\n        // Time step for simulation (if needed, but note: without behavior, we cannot update)\n        // We might leave the update to an external tool, so we just provide the attributes.\n\n        // We might also want to model the forces, but again without constraints we cannot.\n\n        // We are to avoid constraints, so we stop here.\n   }\n\n However, note that the requirement says to compute. Without constraints or operations, we cannot express the computation in SysML.\n\n Given the rules, we are to output a model that satisfies the requirements as much as possible within the allowed subset.\n\n We are allowed to use `item def` for defining types? But note: we are to use the import for ScalarValues, so Real is already available.\n\n We are also to use `port def` and `port` if needed. But in this case, the vehicle doesn't have ports to interact, so maybe not.\n\n Let's consider if we need to break down the vehicle into parts (like wheels, engine) but the requirement is about high-level dynamics.\n\n We are to keep it simple.\n\n Since we cannot define the dynamics equations, we will define the attributes that are needed for the dynamics.\n\n Let's output:\n\n   package VehicleDynamicsModel\n\n   private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n   part def Vehicle {\n        // Vehicle parameters\n        attribute mass : Real;\n        attribute wheelPower : Real;\n        attribute dragCoefficient : Real;\n        attribute rollingResistanceCoefficient : Real;\n\n        // Initial conditions\n        attribute initialSpeed : Real;\n        attribute initialPosition : Real;\n\n        // State variables (to be updated by external simulation)\n        attribute currentSpeed : Real;\n        attribute currentPosition : Real;\n        attribute currentAcceleration : Real;\n        attribute currentTime : Real; // to track simulation time\n\n        // We might also want to have a time step for the simulation, but without behavior, we cannot update.\n        // We leave it as an attribute for the simulation step size.\n        attribute timeStep : Real;\n   }\n\n This model only captures the data, not the behavior. The requirement says to compute and update, but we cannot do that in SysML without operations or constraints.\n\n Given the instructions, we are to avoid operations and constraints, so we output the structure only.\n\n However, note that the requirement says \"automatically calculates and updates\". We are not fulfilling that with the current model.\n\n But note the rules: we are to use a conservative subset and avoid constructs that fail validation.\n\n We have to decide: is this acceptable? The requirement is about modeling, and the computation is to be done by an external tool. The SysML model only captures the data.\n\n Alternatively, we could break down the vehicle into parts that might have ports to exchange force, etc. But again, without constraints, we cannot compute.\n\n Let's stick to the above.\n\n We are to output only the SysML text.\n\n Let's write it.\n\n Note: We are using `part def` and `attribute`.\n\n We are not using `port def` or `connect` because there are no connections in this simple model.\n\n We are also not using `enum def` because we don't have enumerated types.\n\n We are using `private import ScalarValues::*;` to get Real.\n\n We are using a single package.\n\n Let's output."
