We should avoid using it as an identifier.\n\n We can change the attribute name to something else, like `metadata` or `metaInfo`.\n\n Let's change it to `metadata` to avoid the potential keyword clash.\n\n Also, note that the error message says \"expected one of ...\" which includes a list of tokens. This suggests that the parser was expecting something else at that point, and `meta` might be interpreted as a keyword.\n\n Therefore, we change:\n        attribute meta : String;\n to:\n        attribute metadata : String;\n\n Additionally, we must ensure that the rest of the model is consistent. However, note that the `DataFormat` is used in the `DataPort` as an attribute of type `DataFormat`. Changing the attribute name in `DataFormat` does not break the port because the port uses the entire `DataFormat` item. The port does not refer to the individual attributes of `DataFormat`.\n\n Let's update the model accordingly.\n\n Also, note that the previous model had no other errors. We should keep the rest of the structure.\n\n However, let's double-check the entire model for any other potential issues.\n\n We are also told to use a conservative subset and avoid constructs that fail validation. We are using:\n   package, private import, item def, attribute, port def, part def, part, connect.\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n Let's produce the updated model with the change from `meta` to `metadata`."
