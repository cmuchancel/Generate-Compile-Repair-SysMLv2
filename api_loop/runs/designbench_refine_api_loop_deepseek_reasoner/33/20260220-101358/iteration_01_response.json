        "reasoning_content": "We are going to design a SysML v2 model for the camera information processing workflow.\n We will have a package, and within it, we define the necessary parts, ports, and connections.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Define a package for the system.\n 2. Import ScalarValues for basic types.\n 3. Define an enum for the focus status (optional, but might be needed for focusing process).\n 4. Define parts: CameraSystem, which will contain the main functionality.\n 5. Define ports: viewPort (for scene selection), displayPort (for displaying the picture), and possibly internal ports for the image and picture.\n 6. Define internal parts: FocusModule, CaptureModule, DisplayModule (if needed) or just the attributes and connections within the CameraSystem.\n\n However, note that the requirement says: \"The user does not need to be concerned with specific technical details during operation and only needs to complete scene selection and shooting.\"\n\n We are to model the system that automatically handles focusing, capturing, and displaying.\n\n Let's break down:\n - The user interacts with the viewPort (to select a scene) and then triggers the shooting.\n - The system then focuses (we assume a FocusModule that produces an Image).\n - Then the system captures the Image to produce a Picture.\n - Then the system displays the Picture via the displayPort.\n\n We can model this as a part definition for CameraSystem with internal parts for Focus, Capture, and Display.\n\n But note: the requirement says to use `part def`, `part`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect`.\n\n We are allowed to use `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def`, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.\n\n We are to avoid `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, etc.\n\n Let's try to structure:\n\n 1. Package: CameraSystemPackage\n 2. Import ScalarValues.\n 3. Define an enum for focus status: FocusStatus (FOCUSED, NOT_FOCUSED) - if needed.\n 4. Define port definitions:\n    - viewPort: for selecting the scene. We might not need to define a complex port, just a port that can receive the scene selection (maybe a trigger).\n    - displayPort: for displaying the picture.\n\n However, note that the system is processing an image and then a picture. We might need to define `Image` and `Picture` as item definitions.\n\n 5. Define item definitions for Image and Picture.\n\n 6. Define part definitions:\n    - FocusModule: has an output port for Image.\n    - CaptureModule: has an input port for Image and output port for Picture.\n    - DisplayModule: has an input port for Picture.\n\n 7. Define the main part: CameraSystem, which contains:\n    - part focus : FocusModule;\n    - part capture : CaptureModule;\n    - part display : DisplayModule;\n    - port view : viewPort;   // for user to select scene\n    - port display : displayPort; // for displaying the picture\n\n 8. Connect the parts inside CameraSystem:\n    - connect view to focus.input? (But note: the viewPort is for scene selection, which triggers the focus. We might need a trigger port.)\n    - connect focus.imageOutput to capture.imageInput;\n    - connect capture.pictureOutput to display.pictureInput;\n    - connect display.output to the displayPort of the CameraSystem.\n\n However, note that the requirement says the user only selects the scene and then the system automatically does the rest.\n\n We might not need to model the trigger in detail. Instead, we can assume that the viewPort is connected to the focus module to initiate focusing.\n\n Let's define:\n\n  - We'll have a port definition `TriggerPort` for the viewPort? But note, we are to avoid signal and event. So we can use a port that carries a boolean or an enum.\n\n Alternatively, we can skip the trigger and just model the flow of data: from scene (which we can represent as an item) to image to picture.\n\n But the requirement says: \"when a user selects a scene through the camera\u2019s viewfinder (viewPort), the system first focuses on the scene to obtain an image.\"\n\n So the viewPort provides the scene (maybe as an input of type Scene). Then the focus module processes the scene to produce an image.\n\n We can define:\n\n  item def Scene;\n\n  Then the viewPort is of type Scene? But note, the viewPort is a port through which the user selects the scene.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think of the viewPort as a port that provides the scene (like a sensor). We can model it as an output port of the CameraSystem that is connected to the focus module.\n\n  But wait, the user selects the scene via the viewPort, so the viewPort is an input to the system. Then the system (focus module) takes that scene and produces an image.\n\n  So:\n\n   port viewPort : output Scene;   // from the user to the system? Actually, the user provides the scene via the viewPort, so it's an input to the system.\n\n   However, note that in SysML, ports can be both input and output. We can define:\n\n   port def viewPort {\n      attribute scene : Scene;\n   }\n\n   But we are to use `port def` and `port` with simple attributes.\n\n  Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   item def Scene;\n\n   port def viewPort {\n      attribute selectedScene : Scene;\n   }\n\n  And then the viewPort is an input port to the CameraSystem.\n\n  Similarly, for displayPort:\n\n   item def Picture;\n\n   port def displayPort {\n      attribute displayedPicture : Picture;\n   }\n\n  And the displayPort is an output port of the CameraSystem.\n\n  Now, the internal structure:\n\n   The CameraSystem has:\n      - a viewPort (input) of type viewPort.\n      - a displayPort (output) of type displayPort.\n\n      - a part focus : FocusModule;\n      - a part capture : CaptureModule;\n      - a part display : DisplayModule;\n\n   The FocusModule has:\n      - an input port of type viewPort (to get the scene) and an output port for Image.\n\n   We can define:\n\n      port def imagePort {\n          attribute image : Image;\n      }\n\n   Similarly, for capture module:\n\n      port def imageInputPort {\n          attribute image : Image;\n      }\n\n      port def pictureOutputPort {\n          attribute picture : Picture;\n      }\n\n   And for display module:\n\n      port def pictureInputPort {\n          attribute picture : Picture;\n      }\n\n   But note: we can reuse the same port definitions for the same type of data.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n      port def ImagePort {\n          attribute image : Image;\n      }\n\n      port def PicturePort {\n          attribute picture : Picture;\n      }\n\n   And then:\n\n      FocusModule has an output port of type ImagePort.\n      CaptureModule has an input port of type ImagePort and an output port of type PicturePort.\n      DisplayModule has an input port of type PicturePort.\n\n   Now, the connections in CameraSystem:\n\n      connect viewPort to focus.input;   // but note: viewPort is of type viewPort, and focus.input expects a viewPort? Or we can connect the scene attribute.\n\n      Alternatively, we can define the FocusModule to have an input port of type viewPort.\n\n      Let's define:\n\n        part def FocusModule {\n            port input : viewPort;\n            port output : ImagePort;\n        }\n\n        part def CaptureModule {\n            port input : ImagePort;\n            port output : PicturePort;\n        }\n\n        part def DisplayModule {\n            port input : PicturePort;\n            port output : displayPort;   // because displayPort has a Picture attribute? Actually, displayPort has displayedPicture of type Picture.\n        }\n\n   But note: the displayPort of the CameraSystem is of type displayPort, which has a displayedPicture. So the DisplayModule outputs to that.\n\n   However, the DisplayModule's output port must be compatible with the CameraSystem's displayPort.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        part def DisplayModule {\n            port input : PicturePort;\n            port output : displayPort;   // so we define the output port of DisplayModule as displayPort.\n        }\n\n   Then in CameraSystem:\n\n        part focus : FocusModule;\n        part capture : CaptureModule;\n        part display : DisplayModule;\n\n        port view : viewPort;\n        port display : displayPort;\n\n        connect view to focus.input;\n        connect focus.output to capture.input;\n        connect capture.output to display.input;\n        connect display.output to display;   // the port of the CameraSystem\n\n   But note: the last connection is from the display part's output port to the CameraSystem's display port.\n\n   However, the port names might clash. We can rename:\n\n        port systemDisplay : displayPort;\n\n   Then:\n\n        connect display.output to systemDisplay;\n\n   Alternatively, we can name the port of the CameraSystem as `displayOut` or something.\n\n   Let's adjust:\n\n        part def CameraSystem {\n            port view : viewPort;\n            port displayOut : displayPort;\n\n            part focus : FocusModule;\n            part capture : CaptureModule;\n            part display : DisplayModule;\n\n            connect view to focus.input;\n            connect focus.output to capture.input;\n            connect capture.output to display.input;\n            connect display.output to displayOut;\n        }\n\n   Now, we need to define the item definitions for Scene, Image, and Picture.\n\n   We can define:\n\n        item def Scene;\n\n        item def Image;\n\n        item def Picture;\n\n   And the port definitions:\n\n        port def viewPort {\n            attribute selectedScene : Scene;\n        }\n\n        port def ImagePort {\n            attribute image : Image;\n        }\n\n        port def PicturePort {\n            attribute picture : Picture;\n        }\n\n        port def displayPort {\n            attribute displayedPicture : Picture;\n        }\n\n   Now, we also need to define the part definitions for FocusModule, CaptureModule, and DisplayModule.\n\n   However, note that the requirement says to use a conservative subset. We are avoiding operations and state machines.\n\n   We can define the parts without internal behavior for now, just the ports.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   We'll also define an enum for focus status if needed, but if not, we can skip.\n\n   Since the requirement does not specify the need for an enum, we can omit it.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We are to output only the SysML text.\n\n   Let's write the model."
