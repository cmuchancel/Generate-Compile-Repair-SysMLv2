        "reasoning_content": "We are given compiler feedback about the issue: the enum literals are not being recognized in the attribute default values.\n The error is that there is no feature named 'mandatory' or 'optional'. This is because when we use an enum def, we must refer to the enum members with the enum def name as a namespace.\n However, note that in SysML v2, the syntax for enum members is `enum memberName` and when referencing, we use the enum def name followed by `::` and the member name.\n\n Let's look at the enum def:\n     enum def SafetyStatus {\n         enum mandatory;\n         enum optional;\n     }\n\n To reference these in an attribute assignment, we must use:\n     attribute safetyStatus : SafetyStatus = SafetyStatus::mandatory;\n\n Therefore, we need to change every default value for safetyStatus to use the fully qualified name.\n\n We will update the following parts:\n   - Bumper (safetyStatus = mandatory -> SafetyStatus::mandatory)\n   - SeatBelt (same)\n   - DriverAirbag (optional -> SafetyStatus::optional)\n   - PassengerAirbag (same)\n   - ABS (same)\n\n Also, note that the previous model had two ABS parts (one in Chassis and one in SafetySubsystem). This might be intended or might be a duplication.\n The requirement says ABS is optional, so it's okay to have it in two different subsystems? But note that the same ABS part is being used in two different places.\n However, in the model, we have two separate ABS parts: one in Chassis and one in SafetySubsystem. They are two instances of the same ABS part def.\n\n We are not changing the structure, only fixing the enum references.\n\n Let's update the model accordingly."
