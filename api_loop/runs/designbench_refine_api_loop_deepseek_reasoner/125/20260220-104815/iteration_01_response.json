We'll have a package for the vehicle system.\n 2. We'll define an enum for the type of feature: SafetyMandatory, SafetyOptional, Security.\n 3. We'll define a base component def (maybe as an abstract part) for vehicle components, with an attribute for the feature type.\n 4. Then define specific part definitions for each component (seat belt, airbag, etc.) that extend the base component.\n 5. Then define the vehicle as a part that contains these parts.\n\n But note: the requirement says to use `part def` and `part`, and to avoid `block`. So we'll use part definitions.\n\n However, note that the system must be able to filter and organize components by safety or security features and visualize them.\n\n We are to output a SysML v2 model that validates.\n\n Let's structure:\n\n - A package named \"VehicleSafetySecurity\"\n - Inside, we'll have an enum definition for FeatureCategory with members: SafetyMandatory, SafetyOptional, Security.\n - We'll define an abstract part definition \"VehicleComponent\" with an attribute \"category : FeatureCategory\".\n - Then for each specific component, we define a part def that is a subclass of VehicleComponent.\n - Then we define the Vehicle part def that contains parts of these components.\n\n But note: the rules say to use `private import ScalarValues::*`. We'll include that at the top.\n\n We'll keep it minimal and only include the necessary.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note that the requirement says the system is for managing and displaying. We are modeling the structure, not the behavior.\n\n We are to output only the updated SysMLv2 model.\n\n Let's write the code."
