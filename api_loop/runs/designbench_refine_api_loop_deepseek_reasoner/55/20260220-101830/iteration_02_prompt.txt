You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed for comprehensive management and calculation of the quality (mass) of vehicles and their components. Each vehicle is composed of multiple components with measurable mass, and each component is defined with a simple mass attribute. The total mass of a vehicle equals its own mass plus the combined mass of all its components. The system supports recursive composition of components and mass filtering; for example, it is possible to set a threshold so that only subcomponents with mass no less than a specified value are counted. Each vehicle component has a unique serial number, while the complete vehicle has a unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and key subcomponents such as the engine and transmission can be specifically defined along with their masses. In practical application scenarios, users can input mass data for each main component, and the system will automatically summarize the information, providing a clear and straightforward overview of the total vehicle mass. This enables precise mass management for vehicles and their constituent components.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):

    private import ScalarValues::*;

    part def Component {
        attribute serialNumber : String;
        attribute mass : Real;
        part subcomponents : Component[0..*];
    }

    part def Engine :> Component;
    part def Transmission :> Component;

    part def Vehicle {
        attribute vin : String;
        attribute ownMass : Real;
        attribute massThreshold : Real = 0.0;
        part engine : Engine;
        part transmission : Transmission;
        part components : Component[0..*];

        attribute totalMass : Real;
        constraint {
            totalMass = ownMass + 
                engine.mass + 
                transmission.mass + 
                sum(components->select(c|c.mass >= massThreshold).mass) +
                sum(components->select(c|c.mass >= massThreshold).subcomponents->select(sc|sc.mass >= massThreshold).mass);
        }
    }
