You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to implement an information classification management mechanism based on the “traffic light” principle. Information is divided into three levels: “Unclassified,” “Confidential,” and “Secret,” each corresponding to a code and a color: unclassified information uses the code “uncl” and is marked in green; confidential information uses the code “conf” and is marked in yellow; and secret information uses the code “secr” and is marked in red. In addition, the system must also support grade classification. Grade levels include A, B, C, D, and F, which correspond to 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, and 0.0 points, respectively. The classification of different types of information and the scores for grades must be clearly defined and distinguished in the system, so that users can easily and intuitively identify various categories of information and grades during operation and management.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
