        "reasoning_content": "We are given a requirement to model a vehicle fuel system with SysML v2.\n The system includes:\n   - A vehicle with a fuel tank assembly and an engine.\n   - Fuel lines connecting the fuel tank assembly and the engine for supply and return.\n   - The fuel tank assembly supplies fuel to the engine, and the engine returns unused fuel to the fuel tank.\n   - The system monitors and transmits fuel temperature information for safety and efficiency.\n\n We are to use a conservative subset of SysML v2, focusing on:\n   package, private import ScalarValues::*, enum def, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, connect.\n\n We are to avoid: block, property, enumeration, signal def, event def, state machine, transition def, operation def, precondition, postcondition, when, and quoted constraints.\n\n We are to output only SysML text.\n\n Let's break down the model:\n\n 1. We have a vehicle that contains a fuel tank assembly and an engine.\n 2. There are fuel lines (supply and return) connecting the fuel tank assembly and the engine.\n 3. We have a fuel temperature monitoring system.\n\n We can think of the following structure:\n\n - A package for the fuel system.\n - We'll use part definitions for the vehicle, fuel tank assembly, engine, and fuel lines.\n - We'll use port definitions for the interfaces (fuel supply and return, and temperature data).\n - We'll use an item definition for the fuel (maybe with a temperature attribute) and for the temperature signal.\n\n However, note that we are to avoid signal def. Instead, we can use item def for the temperature data.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Create a package.\n 2. Import ScalarValues (for basic types).\n 3. Define an item for fuel, which might have a temperature attribute.\n 4. Define ports for fuel flow (in and out) and for temperature data.\n 5. Define parts for the fuel tank, engine, and fuel lines.\n\n But note: the requirement says the system monitors and transmits fuel temperature. So we need a way to represent the temperature data flow.\n\n Let's think about the connections:\n\n  - Fuel flows from the fuel tank to the engine (supply) and from the engine back to the fuel tank (return).\n  - Temperature data is monitored and transmitted. We don't specify exactly where, but we can assume that the fuel tank or the fuel line has a temperature sensor and sends the data to some monitoring system.\n\n However, the requirement is to model the structure and operating principles. We are not required to model the control system in detail.\n\n We can have:\n\n  - FuelTankAssembly: has a port for fuel supply (out) and a port for fuel return (in). Also, it has a port for temperature data out.\n  - Engine: has a port for fuel supply (in) and a port for fuel return (out). Also, it has a port for temperature data in? Not necessarily, the temperature might be measured in the fuel tank or in the fuel line.\n\n Alternatively, we can have a temperature sensor as a separate part. But the requirement says the system monitors and transmits the fuel temperature, so we can assume that the fuel tank or the fuel line has a temperature sensor.\n\n Let's simplify: We assume that the fuel tank assembly includes a temperature sensor and can output the temperature data.\n\n We'll define:\n\n  - An item definition for Fuel, which has an attribute for temperature.\n  - An item definition for TemperatureData, which might just be a scalar value.\n\n However, note that we are to avoid complex structures. We can use ScalarValues::Real for temperature.\n\n We can have:\n\n  - A port definition for fuel flow: this is an item flow of Fuel.\n  - A port definition for temperature data: this is an item flow of TemperatureData (or just Real).\n\n But note: the requirement says \"monitors and transmits information on the fuel temperature\". We can model the temperature data as a separate flow.\n\n We'll create:\n\n  - Port definitions:\n        port def FuelPort {\n            attribute flow : Fuel;\n        }\n\n        port def TemperatureDataPort {\n            attribute data : Real;\n        }\n\n  However, note that we are to use `port def` and then `port` inside parts. Also, we can use `item def` for Fuel and TemperatureData.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the built-in types from ScalarValues and not define an item for Fuel if it's just for flow. But the requirement mentions fuel temperature, so we might want to have an item for Fuel that has temperature.\n\n But note: the fuel temperature is monitored, so we might have a sensor that measures the temperature of the fuel and then sends that data. So the fuel flow and the temperature data flow are separate.\n\n We can do:\n\n  - The fuel flow is of type Fuel (which has temperature as an attribute). Then, the temperature data is extracted from the fuel? But the requirement says \"monitors and transmits\", so we might have a sensor that reads the temperature and then sends it.\n\n Let's think of two separate flows:\n\n  1. The physical fuel flow (from tank to engine and back).\n  2. The temperature data flow (from a sensor to some monitoring system).\n\n We can model:\n\n  - The fuel tank has a temperature sensor that outputs the temperature of the fuel in the tank.\n\n But the requirement is about the fuel temperature in the entire flow. We can assume that the temperature is measured in the tank and then transmitted.\n\n Alternatively, we can have the fuel lines also have temperature sensors? The requirement doesn't specify.\n\n Let's assume that the fuel tank assembly includes a temperature sensor and provides the temperature data of the fuel inside.\n\n We can model:\n\n  - The fuel tank assembly has:\n        - A fuel supply port (outputs fuel)\n        - A fuel return port (receives fuel)\n        - A temperature data port (outputs the temperature of the fuel in the tank)\n\n  - The engine has:\n        - A fuel supply port (receives fuel)\n        - A fuel return port (outputs unused fuel)\n\n  - We have two fuel lines: one for supply and one for return.\n\n  - We also have a connection for the temperature data from the fuel tank to some monitoring system? The requirement doesn't specify where the temperature data goes. We can assume it goes to a vehicle monitoring system.\n\n  We'll add a part for the vehicle monitoring system that receives the temperature data.\n\n Steps in the model:\n\n 1. Define item for Fuel (with temperature attribute) and for TemperatureData (or use Real).\n\n 2. Define port definitions for fuel and temperature data.\n\n 3. Define the parts (FuelTankAssembly, Engine, FuelLine, VehicleMonitoringSystem).\n\n 4. Define the connections.\n\n However, note that we are to use `connect A to B;` and not `connect A -> B`.\n\n Let's outline:\n\n  - The fuel tank assembly has:\n        port fuelSupply : FuelPort;\n        port fuelReturn : FuelPort;\n        port tempData : TemperatureDataPort;\n\n  - The engine has:\n        port fuelSupply : FuelPort;\n        port fuelReturn : FuelPort;\n\n  - The fuel line (supply) connects the fuel tank's fuelSupply to the engine's fuelSupply.\n  - The fuel line (return) connects the engine's fuelReturn to the fuel tank's fuelReturn.\n\n  - The vehicle monitoring system has a port for temperature data.\n\n  - Connect the fuel tank's tempData to the vehicle monitoring system's temperature data port.\n\n But note: we are to use `part` and `connect` in an enclosing part (the vehicle).\n\n We'll have a part definition for the vehicle that contains:\n\n        part fuelTank : FuelTankAssembly;\n        part engine : Engine;\n        part supplyLine : FuelLine;\n        part returnLine : FuelLine;\n        part monitor : VehicleMonitoringSystem;\n\n        connect fuelTank.fuelSupply to supplyLine.inlet;\n        connect supplyLine.outlet to engine.fuelSupply;\n\n        connect engine.fuelReturn to returnLine.inlet;\n        connect returnLine.outlet to fuelTank.fuelReturn;\n\n        connect fuelTank.tempData to monitor.tempDataPort;\n\n However, note that the fuel line might be a simple connector. We can model it as a part with two ports.\n\n Alternatively, we can connect directly:\n\n        connect fuelTank.fuelSupply to engine.fuelSupply;\n\n But the requirement says there are fuel lines. So we model the fuel line as a part that has two ports (inlet and outlet) and is of type FuelLine.\n\n Let's define:\n\n        part def FuelLine {\n            port inlet : FuelPort;\n            port outlet : FuelPort;\n        }\n\n Then, the supplyLine and returnLine are instances of FuelLine.\n\n Now, let's write the code.\n\n We'll create:\n\n        package FuelSystem {\n            private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n            item def Fuel {\n                attribute temperature : Real;\n            }\n\n            item def TemperatureData {\n                attribute value : Real;\n            }\n\n            port def FuelPort {\n                attribute flow : Fuel;\n            }\n\n            port def TemperatureDataPort {\n                attribute data : TemperatureData;\n            }\n\n            part def FuelTankAssembly {\n                port fuelSupply : FuelPort;\n                port fuelReturn : FuelPort;\n                port tempData : TemperatureDataPort;\n            }\n\n            part def Engine {\n                port fuelSupply : FuelPort;\n                port fuelReturn : FuelPort;\n            }\n\n            part def FuelLine {\n                port inlet : FuelPort;\n                port outlet : FuelPort;\n            }\n\n            part def VehicleMonitoringSystem {\n                port tempDataPort : TemperatureDataPort;\n            }\n\n            part def Vehicle {\n                part fuelTank : FuelTankAssembly;\n                part engine : Engine;\n                part supplyLine : FuelLine;\n                part returnLine : FuelLine;\n                part monitor : VehicleMonitoringSystem;\n\n                connect fuelTank.fuelSupply to supplyLine.inlet;\n                connect supplyLine.outlet to engine.fuelSupply;\n\n                connect engine.fuelReturn to returnLine.inlet;\n                connect returnLine.outlet to fuelTank.fuelReturn;\n\n                connect fuelTank.tempData to monitor.tempDataPort;\n            }\n        }\n\n However, note that the requirement says the fuel tank assembly supplies fuel to the engine and the engine returns unused fuel. Our model has:\n\n        fuelTank.fuelSupply -> supplyLine -> engine.fuelSupply (for supply)\n        engine.fuelReturn -> returnLine -> fuelTank.fuelReturn (for return)\n\n This matches.\n\n Also, the temperature data from the fuel tank is sent to the monitor.\n\n But wait: the requirement says \"monitors and transmits information on the fuel temperature\". We are transmitting the temperature of the fuel in the tank. We are not modeling the temperature of the fuel in the lines or in the engine. However, the requirement might be satisfied by this if we assume that the fuel temperature is measured in the tank.\n\n Alternatively, we could have the fuel line also measure temperature? The requirement does not specify. We stick to the fuel tank.\n\n We'll output the above model.\n\n However, note that the validator might require that the connections are between compatible ports. We are connecting FuelPort to FuelPort and TemperatureDataPort to TemperatureDataPort.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly."
