You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to perform simulation analysis on vehicle fuel economy. By setting different urban and highway driving scenarios, it calculates the actual fuel economy of vehicles under these conditions to verify whether they meet the requirement of exceeding 30 miles per gallon. Vehicle parameters include curb weight, load, wheel diameter, transmission efficiency, and others. Under given driving trajectories and speed variations, the model analyzes the required wheel power, applies vehicle dynamics to calculate acceleration and energy consumption, and further estimates the actual engine power demand. Ultimately, it determines the corresponding fuel consumption and fuel economy in terms of liters per 100 kilometers. Users can use these results to assess whether the vehicle design meets energy-saving, emissions reduction, and regulatory compliance requirements in real-world use scenarios.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
