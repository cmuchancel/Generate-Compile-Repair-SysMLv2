You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used for the automotive fuel system and covers the requirements for components such as the fuel tank assembly, fuel pump, and fuel tank. The fuel tank assembly provides an outlet interface for fuel (including a return function), enabling the delivery of fuel to the engine or other components, as well as the reception of returned fuel. The fuel pump, installed inside the fuel tank assembly, serves to pump fuel from the fuel tank and supply it to the engine, while also being capable of receiving returned fuel. The system is able to monitor and transmit fuel temperature information. It is required that fuel can circulate efficiently and safely among all components, meeting the vehicle's overall requirements for fuel supply and return functions, and ensuring normal fuel supply to the engine.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package FuelSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def Fuel;
    item def TemperatureInfo;

    port def FuelOutlet {
        attribute fuel : Fuel;
    }

    port def FuelReturn {
        attribute fuel : Fuel;
    }

    port def TemperaturePort {
        attribute info : TemperatureInfo;
    }

    part def FuelTank {
        port outlet : FuelOutlet;
        port return : FuelReturn;
        port temperature : TemperaturePort;
    }

    part def FuelPump {
        port inlet : FuelReturn;
        port outlet : FuelOutlet;
        port return : FuelReturn;
    }

    part def FuelTankAssembly {
        port mainOutlet : FuelOutlet;
        port mainReturn : FuelReturn;
        port tempSensor : TemperaturePort;

        part tank : FuelTank;
        part pump : FuelPump;

        connect tank.outlet to pump.inlet;
        connect pump.outlet to mainOutlet;
        connect mainReturn to pump.return;
        connect pump.return to tank.return;
        connect tank.temperature to tempSensor;
    }
}
