The error messages suggest that the keyword `value` is not recognized.\n In SysML v2, the correct way to define enumeration literals is with the keyword `enum` (not `value`).\n Let's change the enum definitions accordingly.\n\n Additionally, we note that the compiler feedback also shows an error for `attribute` in line 37, but that might be because the previous enum errors caused the parser to be in a state where `attribute` is unexpected.\n We will fix the enum definitions first and then check if there are any other issues.\n\n We are also going to keep the same structure and try to make minimal changes.\n\n Let's change:\n   `enum def PerformanceRequirement { value Standard; value High; }`\n to:\n   `enum def PerformanceRequirement { enum Standard; enum High; }`\n\n Similarly for the other enums.\n\n Also, note that the compiler feedback truncates, but we can see that the error for line 37 (which is `attribute requirement : PerformanceRequirement;`) might be because of the previous errors.\n\n We'll change the enum literals to use `enum` and then re-evaluate.\n\n However, note that the requirement says: \"Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside\". The previous attempt used `value` which is not correct for SysML v2 (as per the feedback). The correct keyword is `enum` for enumeration literals.\n\n Let's adjust the entire model accordingly."
