The character '\u03c0' is not a standard ASCII character and might not be allowed.\n\n We can change the attribute name to use a Latin alphabet character, e.g., \"pi\".\n\n Also, note that the requirement says to have numerical precision up to 20 decimal places.\n The given values for e and \u03c0 are provided with 20 decimal places, but note that the Real type in SysML may have limitations.\n However, we are using the ScalarValues library, which defines Real. We assume it can handle such precision.\n\n Let's fix the attribute name for \u03c0 to \"pi\".\n\n Also, note that the feedback does not mention any other errors, but we should also check if the comment syntax is allowed.\n The comment \"// m/s\" might be acceptable, but if not, we can remove or adjust. However, the feedback did not flag that.\n\n Let's change:\n   attribute \u03c0 : Real = 3.14159265358979323846;\n to:\n   attribute pi : Real = 3.14159265358979323846;\n\n We'll keep the rest of the model the same.\n\n However, note that the requirement says to have clear SI unit annotations. We are using comments for now.\n Alternatively, we could define a string attribute for units, but the requirement does not specify the exact way to represent units.\n Since the problem says to use a conservative subset, we stick to comments.\n\n If the validator does not accept comments, we can remove them. But the feedback did not flag comments.\n\n Let's output the fixed model."
