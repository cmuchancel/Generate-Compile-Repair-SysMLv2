        "reasoning_content": "We are given a previous attempt and compiler feedback. The errors indicate parsing errors at lines 24, 27, and 30, which are the closing braces and semicolons for the parts in the exampleSystem.\n\nLooking at the structure of the previous attempt:\n\nIn the exampleSystem, we have:\n```\npart exampleSystem : System {\n    part component1 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification : SecurityLevel = SecurityLevel::Confidential;\n    };\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe error message suggests that after the attribute assignment, we are using `};` but the parser expects something else. The issue might be that we are trying to define a part with an attribute assignment in the context of an instance (exampleSystem). In SysML v2, when we are defining an instance (exampleSystem) and then defining its parts, we are not allowed to redefine the attributes of the part type? Or perhaps the syntax for assigning values to attributes in a part instance is different.\n\nAlternatively, note that the part definitions in the exampleSystem are actually part usages (instances) and we are trying to set the attribute for each instance. However, the way we wrote it might be incorrect.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure:\n\nWe have a part definition for Component with an attribute. Then we have a part definition for System that has three parts of type Component. Then we have an exampleSystem that is an instance of System and we want to set the securityClassification for each component.\n\nIn SysML v2, when we create an instance of System (exampleSystem), we are creating an instance of the System part definition. The parts inside exampleSystem are instances of Component. We can set the attributes of these instances by using an initial value? But note that the part definition for Component does not specify a default value for the securityClassification.\n\nWe have two options:\n1. Set the attribute values in the exampleSystem by using an assignment in the part instance, but note that the syntax for part instances in a part definition might be different.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the attribute values in the part definition for each component in the exampleSystem by using a nested part definition? But that might be overcomplicating.\n\nLooking at the error, it's possible that the parser does not expect a semicolon after the closing brace of the part instance. Let's try to remove the semicolons after the closing braces of the part instances in the exampleSystem.\n\nWait, the error message says \"Unexpected ';'\" at the line with `};`. So maybe we should remove the semicolon after the closing brace.\n\nBut note that in the part definition for System, we had:\n```\npart component1 : Component;\n```\nand that was accepted. So in a part definition, we end with a semicolon. However, in the exampleSystem (which is a part definition with a default instance?) we are trying to define the part instances and then set their attributes. The syntax might be:\n\n```\npart exampleSystem : System {\n    part component1 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Confidential;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, the original attempt had:\n```\npart exampleSystem : System {\n    part component1 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification : SecurityLevel = SecurityLevel::Confidential;\n    };\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe error might be that we are using both a colon and an equals? Or maybe we are not allowed to specify the type again in the instance.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the attribute value in a different way. Since the part definition for Component already has an attribute of type SecurityLevel, we can set it by using an initial value expression in the part instance? But the syntax for that is not clear.\n\nAnother thought: In SysML v2, we can use a \"bind\" statement to bind the attribute of a part to a value. However, the rules say to avoid \"bind\" if possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can define the exampleSystem without redefining the parts and then set the attributes in a separate step? But that might require more complex constructs.\n\nGiven the feedback, let's try a simpler approach:\n\nWe can define the Component with a default value for the attribute, but then every component would have the same default. We don't want that.\n\nAlternatively, we can create three different part definitions for the three components with different security levels, and then use them in the exampleSystem. But that would not be minimal.\n\nLooking at the rules, we are allowed to use `part` and `attribute` and `enum def`. We are also allowed to use `connect` but that's not needed here.\n\nLet's try to restructure the exampleSystem without the semicolons after the part instance definitions, and also without re-specifying the type of the attribute.\n\nWe can try:\n\n```\npart exampleSystem : System {\n    part component1 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Confidential;\n    }\n    part component2 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Unclassified;\n    }\n    part component3 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Secret;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut note: the attribute in the Component part definition is `securityClassification : SecurityLevel`. In the instance, we are setting it without the type. This might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the attribute in the part instance by using an assignment in the part definition? Actually, the part instance is being defined and we are giving it a value for the attribute.\n\nLet's try to adjust the exampleSystem accordingly.\n\nAlso, note that the previous attempt had a semicolon after each part instance in the exampleSystem, and the error points to that. So let's remove those semicolons.\n\nWe'll also remove the type specification in the attribute assignment in the instance because the type is already known from the part definition.\n\nUpdated code for exampleSystem:\n\n```\npart exampleSystem : System {\n    part component1 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Confidential;\n    }\n    part component2 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Unclassified;\n    }\n    part component3 : Component {\n        attribute securityClassification = SecurityLevel::Secret;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut note: the entire model is in a package. We are also using an import. We are keeping that.\n\nLet's write the entire model with this change.\n\nWe must also note that the part definitions in System are just declarations, and we are overriding them in the exampleSystem by providing the attribute values. This might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can remove the part definitions in the System part definition and only define the parts in the exampleSystem? But then the System part definition would be empty.\n\nWe want to show that the System has three components and then in the exampleSystem we set their security levels.\n\nLet's try the above and see if it validates.\n\nWe are also following the rule to output only SysML text with no prose.\n\nSo the revised model:"
