You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system must be capable of calculating the core parameters of vehicle dynamics, including the vehicle's power output, acceleration, speed, and position under various operating conditions. It should accurately calculate the vehicle’s actual available power output based on key input parameters such as wheel power, aerodynamic drag coefficient, friction coefficient, vehicle mass, and speed. Additionally, the system should be able to deduce the vehicle’s acceleration based on effective power, mass, and current speed, and utilize the obtained acceleration, initial speed, and time to calculate the vehicle’s speed at any given moment. Furthermore, the system should have the capability to estimate vehicle displacement based on speed and time, helping end-users comprehensively analyze and predict the dynamic performance of the vehicle under specific operating conditions. The overall requirements emphasize high accuracy, clear logical relationships between parameters, and results that are convenient for practical engineering applications.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
