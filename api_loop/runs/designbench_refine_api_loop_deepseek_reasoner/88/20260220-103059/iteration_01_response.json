        "reasoning_content": "We are generating a SysML v2 model for the vehicle safety compliance system.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have a package for the system.\n 2. We need to define safety features, both mandatory and optional.\n 3. We have components: vehicle interior, vehicle body, chassis system.\n 4. We have specific parts: seat belts (two, mandatory), driver\u2019s airbag (optional), bumper (mandatory), keyless entry (optional), tires (fixed number), ABS (optional).\n 5. We need to categorize safety parts and indicate which are required and which are optional.\n\n We'll use:\n   - `package` to contain everything.\n   - `part def` for components and their parts.\n   - `attribute` for properties like number of tires, and to indicate if a feature is mandatory or optional.\n   - `enum def` for categorizing safety requirements (e.g., mandatory, optional).\n\n However, note that the requirements mention that the system categorizes and manages safety-related parts. We can use an enumeration for the safety requirement type.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n 1. Define an enumeration for safety requirement classification: `SafetyRequirementKind` with values `mandatory` and `optional`.\n 2. Define a part definition for `SafetyFeature` that has an attribute `requirement : SafetyRequirementKind` to indicate if it's mandatory or optional.\n 3. Then, for each specific safety feature (seat belt, airbag, bumper, keyless entry, ABS) we can either create a part definition that is a subclass of `SafetyFeature` or use attributes to specify.\n\n Alternatively, we can have a part definition for each component and then use composition to include the safety features.\n\n But note: the requirement says \"all components of the vehicle possess corresponding safety features\". So we can have:\n\n   - A `Vehicle` part that is composed of `Interior`, `Body`, `Chassis`.\n   - Each of these has its own safety features.\n\n However, the requirement also says that the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts. So we might want to have a list of safety features in the vehicle.\n\n Let's try:\n\n   - Define `SafetyFeature` as a part definition with a `requirement` attribute.\n   - Then define specific safety features as parts of the components.\n\n But note: the requirement says that the system manages safety features and distinguishes which are required and which are optional.\n\n We can have:\n\n   - `Vehicle` has parts: `interior`, `body`, `chassis`.\n   - Each of these has its safety features as parts.\n\n However, the requirement says that the vehicle interior must have two seat belts (both mandatory). So we can have:\n\n   - `Interior` has two `SeatBelt` parts (each with requirement mandatory) and one `DriversAirbag` (optional).\n\n Similarly, for the body: `Bumper` (mandatory) and `KeylessEntry` (optional).\n For the chassis: fixed number of tires (let's say 4) and `ABS` (optional).\n\n We are also told that the number of tires is fixed. We can model tires as a part with a fixed multiplicity (4) and they are mandatory? But note: the requirement doesn't explicitly say tires are a safety feature? It says the chassis system has a fixed number of tires and ABS is an optional safety feature. We might consider tires as a necessary part but not necessarily a safety feature? The requirement says \"the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts\". So if tires are not considered safety-related, then we don't need to mark them as a safety feature. However, the requirement in the chassis system mentions the number of tires is fixed and ABS is optional. We can model tires as a part of the chassis with a fixed multiplicity, but without a safety requirement attribute.\n\n Alternatively, we can have:\n\n   - `Chassis` has parts: `tires : Tire[4]` and `abs : ABS` (optional).\n\n But note: the requirement says that the system manages safety-related parts. We are not told that tires are safety-related. So we can model them as a part without the safety requirement attribute.\n\n Let's design:\n\n   - We'll create an enumeration `SafetyRequirementKind` with `mandatory` and `optional`.\n   - We'll create a part definition `SafetyFeature` that has an attribute `requirement : SafetyRequirementKind`.\n   - Then, for each safety feature (SeatBelt, Airbag, Bumper, KeylessEntry, ABS) we create a part definition that is a subclass of `SafetyFeature`.\n\n But note: the requirement says that the vehicle interior has two seat belts (both mandatory). So we can create a part definition `SeatBelt` that is a subclass of `SafetyFeature` and then set its requirement to mandatory by default? Or we can set it in the instance.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid subclassing and instead use an attribute in the containing part to specify the requirement. However, the requirement says that the system categorizes and manages safety-related parts. So it might be better to have a common base type for safety features.\n\n However, note that the requirement says that the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts and further distinguishes which are required and which are optional. So having a base type with the requirement attribute is good.\n\n But note: we are to use a conservative subset. We are allowed `part def` and `attribute`.\n\n Let's try:\n\n   - Define an enumeration for the safety requirement kind.\n   - Define a part definition for `SafetyFeature` with an attribute `requirement : SafetyRequirementKind`.\n   - Then, define specific safety features as parts that are subclasses of `SafetyFeature`? However, note that we are to avoid complex constructs. Alternatively, we can define each safety feature as a part definition and then add an attribute of type `SafetyRequirementKind` to each.\n\n But that would be repetitive. We can use inheritance? The rules don't forbid it, but they don't mention it either. The rules say: `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, etc. We can try using `:>` for subclassing? The SysML v2 text for subclassing is `:> BasePart`. However, the rules don't explicitly mention it, but they don't forbid it.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid inheritance and just have each safety feature part definition include an attribute of type `SafetyRequirementKind`. But then we don't have a common type for safety features.\n\n Let's look at the requirement: \"the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts\". We might want to have a common type to group them. But the requirement doesn't specify that we need to group them in a list, only that we categorize and manage them.\n\n Since the requirement is to output a minimal structure, we can avoid inheritance and just define each safety feature with its own attribute.\n\n However, note that the requirement says that the system manages safety-related parts and distinguishes which are required and which are optional. We can have:\n\n   - In the `Vehicle` part, we can have a list of safety features? But the rules don't specify that we need to have a list. We can just model the parts and their safety features.\n\n Let's try to model the vehicle and its components:\n\n   - We'll have a part definition for `Vehicle` that has parts: `interior : Interior`, `body : Body`, `chassis : Chassis`.\n   - Then, each of these components has their own parts.\n\n We'll define:\n\n   - `Interior` has:\n        seatBelts : SeatBelt[2];\n        driversAirbag : DriversAirbag;\n\n   - `Body` has:\n        bumper : Bumper;\n        keylessEntry : KeylessEntry;\n\n   - `Chassis` has:\n        tires : Tire[4];\n        abs : ABS;\n\n Then, for each safety feature (SeatBelt, DriversAirbag, Bumper, KeylessEntry, ABS) we define a part definition with an attribute `requirement : SafetyRequirementKind`.\n\n But note: the requirement says that the number of tires is fixed and ABS is optional. We don't have to mark tires as a safety feature if they are not considered safety-related. We can leave tires without a requirement attribute.\n\n However, the requirement says that the chassis system has the tires and ABS. We can model tires as a part without a safety requirement attribute and ABS as a part with the safety requirement attribute.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   - `Tire` as a part definition without a safety requirement attribute.\n\n But note: the requirement says that the system categorizes and manages all safety-related parts. Since tires are not safety-related, we don't need to categorize them.\n\n So, let's create:\n\n   - `SafetyRequirementKind` enumeration.\n   - For each safety feature (SeatBelt, DriversAirbag, Bumper, KeylessEntry, ABS) we create a part definition with an attribute `requirement : SafetyRequirementKind`.\n\n Then, in the components, we set the requirement for each safety feature part.\n\n However, note that the requirement says that both seat belts are mandatory. So we set the requirement of each `SeatBelt` to `mandatory`.\n\n But note: we are creating two instances of `SeatBelt` in the `Interior`. We can set the requirement for each instance? Or we can set the default in the `SeatBelt` part definition? We can set the default in the part definition to `mandatory` and then override if needed? But in this case, both are mandatory.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the requirement in the part definition for each safety feature to reflect the default for that type, and then if an instance is different, we can set it in the instance. But the requirement says that the system categorizes and manages the safety features, so we want to set the requirement per instance? Or per type? The requirement says that the driver\u2019s airbag is optional. So we set the `DriversAirbag` part definition to have a default requirement of `optional`? But note: the requirement says that the driver\u2019s airbag is optional and not mandatory. So we can set the default for `DriversAirbag` to `optional`.\n\n Similarly, for the bumper (mandatory) and keyless entry (optional) and ABS (optional).\n\n But note: the requirement says that the bumper is required as a mandatory safety component. So we set the `Bumper` part definition to have a default requirement of `mandatory`.\n\n However, the requirement says that the system manages the safety parts and distinguishes which are required and which are optional. It doesn't say that the requirement is per type or per instance. We are modeling the vehicle, and in this vehicle, we have two seat belts that are mandatory, one optional airbag, etc.\n\n We can set the requirement in the part definition as a default, and then in the vehicle, we don't have to set it again. But note: the requirement might be that the system can have different vehicles with different configurations. But the requirement doesn't specify that.\n\n Since the requirement is for one vehicle, we can set the default in the part definition and then use the default.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the requirement in the instance. But note: the rules don't specify that we can set attributes in instances? We can set the attribute in the part definition and then, when we create an instance, we can set the value? The SysML v2 text allows setting attributes in part definitions and then overriding in instances? We are to use a conservative subset.\n\n Let's try to set the default in the part definition and then, if we need to change it in the instance, we can. But note: the requirement says that the vehicle interior has two seat belts, both mandatory. We can set the `SeatBelt` part definition to have `requirement = SafetyRequirementKind::mandatory`. Then, when we create two instances of `SeatBelt` in the `Interior`, they will both be mandatory.\n\n Similarly, we set the `DriversAirbag` part definition to have `requirement = SafetyRequirementKind::optional`.\n\n But note: the requirement says that the driver\u2019s airbag is optional and not mandatory. So we set it to optional.\n\n For the bumper, we set to mandatory, for keyless entry and ABS to optional.\n\n We don't set a requirement for tires because they are not a safety feature.\n\n Let's write the SysML v2 text:\n\n We'll have:\n\n   - A package `VehicleSafetyComplianceSystem`.\n   - An enumeration `SafetyRequirementKind` with `mandatory` and `optional`.\n   - Part definitions for each safety feature and for the components.\n\n We'll also have a `Vehicle` part that composes the interior, body, and chassis.\n\n Let's write it step by step."
