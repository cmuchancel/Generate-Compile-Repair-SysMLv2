This might be because of the way we are terminating the enum definition.\n\n Let me check the previous attempt: \n   enum def SensorStatus {\n        enum Ready;\n        enum Updating;\n        enum Updated;\n        enum Error;\n    };\n\n The error points at the `};` line. It's possible that the parser expects the enum definition to end with `}` and not `};`.\n\n In SysML v2, the syntax for an enum definition does not have a semicolon after the closing brace.\n\n Let's change:\n   };\n to\n   }\n\n Also, note that the same applies to the part definitions. They should end with `}` and not `};`.\n\n However, the error is specifically on the enum definition. Let's adjust accordingly.\n\n Additionally, note that the part definitions in the previous attempt are also closed with `}` and not `};` in the provided code, but wait: \n   part def Sensor {\n        ... \n    }   <-- no semicolon here, which is correct.\n\n But in the provided code, the part def Sensor is closed with `}` and then the next part def starts. That's correct.\n\n However, the enum def is closed with `};` which is incorrect.\n\n Let's fix the enum definition and also ensure we don't have any other similar issues.\n\n We'll change the enum definition to:\n\n   enum def SensorStatus {\n        enum Ready;\n        enum Updating;\n        enum Updated;\n        enum Error;\n   }\n\n And then the rest of the code remains.\n\n However, note that the package is closed with `}` and no semicolon, which is correct.\n\n Let's rewrite the entire code with the fix.\n\n We are also going to keep the same structure and minimal changes.\n\n We are not using any of the avoided constructs, so we should be safe.\n\n Let's output the corrected code."
