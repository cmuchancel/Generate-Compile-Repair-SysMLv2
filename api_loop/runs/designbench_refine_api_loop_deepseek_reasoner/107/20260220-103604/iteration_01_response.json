        "reasoning_content": "We are generating a SysML v2 model for a vehicle-trailer hitching system.\n We are to use a conservative subset of SysML v2 that is robust with syside.\n We have requirements for a system that allows connecting and disconnecting a vehicle and trailer via a hitch ball and coupler.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll create a package for our model.\n 2. We'll import ScalarValues (as per the rules) for basic types.\n 3. We'll define the necessary parts: Vehicle and Trailer, each with a frame and the hitching components (hitch ball and trailer coupler).\n 4. We'll define a connection mechanism between the hitch ball and the trailer coupler.\n\n Since we are to use minimal structure and avoid problematic constructs, we'll stick to:\n   package, private import ScalarValues::*, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, and connect.\n\n We note that the hitching mechanism involves a physical connection. We can model the hitch ball and coupler as parts.\n\n We are to model the vehicle and trailer as separate parts, each having a frame and the hitching component.\n\n We'll define:\n   - A part definition for the vehicle frame and the hitch ball.\n   - A part definition for the trailer frame and the trailer coupler.\n\n We can then connect the hitch ball to the trailer coupler.\n\n However, note that the rules allow `connect A to B;` for connections.\n\n We'll also need to model the connection state? But the requirement is about the mechanism to connect and disconnect.\n\n Since the requirement is about a mechanism, we might model the physical connection as an item that can be connected or disconnected.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the hitching mechanism as an assembly of the hitch ball and the trailer coupler.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n   Vehicle:\n      - has a frame (VehicleFrame)\n      - has a hitch ball (HitchBall) attached to the frame.\n\n   Trailer:\n      - has a frame (TrailerFrame)\n      - has a trailer coupler (TrailerCoupler) attached to the frame.\n\n   The connection is between the HitchBall and the TrailerCoupler.\n\n We can define:\n\n   part def VehicleFrame {\n   }\n\n   part def HitchBall {\n   }\n\n   part def TrailerFrame {\n   }\n\n   part def TrailerCoupler {\n   }\n\n Then, in the Vehicle part, we compose:\n   part frame : VehicleFrame;\n   part hitchBall : HitchBall;\n\n   and connect the hitchBall to the frame? But we are not given how they are attached.\n\n Similarly for the Trailer.\n\n However, the requirement says the vehicle and trailer each have independent structural frames, and the hitch ball is installed on the vehicle frame, the coupler on the trailer frame.\n\n We can model the installation as a connection between the frame and the hitching component.\n\n But note: the vehicle and trailer are to be connected via the hitching mechanism. So we have two levels of connection:\n   1. The hitch ball is attached to the vehicle frame.\n   2. The trailer coupler is attached to the trailer frame.\n   3. The hitch ball and trailer coupler can be connected to each other.\n\n We are to model the system that allows the vehicle and trailer to be connected or disconnected.\n\n We'll use ports to represent the connection points.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   port def AttachmentPort {\n   }\n\n   Then, on the VehicleFrame, we can have a port for attaching the hitch ball.\n   Similarly, on the TrailerFrame, for the trailer coupler.\n\n   Also, the HitchBall and TrailerCoupler can have ports to attach to each other.\n\n But note: the hitch ball is installed on the vehicle frame, so we can have:\n\n   In VehicleFrame:\n      port hitchBallAttachment : AttachmentPort;\n\n   In HitchBall:\n      port vehicleAttachment : AttachmentPort;   // for attaching to the vehicle frame\n      port trailerCouplerAttachment : ?  // for attaching to the trailer coupler\n\n   Similarly for the trailer.\n\n However, the hitch ball and trailer coupler are two separate parts that connect to each other.\n\n We can define a port def for the hitching connection:\n\n   port def HitchingPort {\n   }\n\n   Then, the HitchBall has a hitchingPort, and the TrailerCoupler has a hitchingPort.\n\n   They can be connected.\n\n But note: the hitch ball is attached to the vehicle frame, and the trailer coupler to the trailer frame.\n\n So we have:\n\n   Vehicle:\n      part frame : VehicleFrame {\n          port hitchBallMount : AttachmentPort;\n      }\n      part hitchBall : HitchBall {\n          port vehicleMount : AttachmentPort;\n          port hitchingPoint : HitchingPort;\n      }\n      connect frame.hitchBallMount to hitchBall.vehicleMount;\n\n   Trailer:\n      part frame : TrailerFrame {\n          port couplerMount : AttachmentPort;\n      }\n      part coupler : TrailerCoupler {\n          port trailerMount : AttachmentPort;\n          port hitchingPoint : HitchingPort;\n      }\n      connect frame.couplerMount to coupler.trailerMount;\n\n   Then, when the vehicle and trailer are connected, we connect:\n      connect hitchBall.hitchingPoint to coupler.hitchingPoint;\n\n However, note that the requirement is about a system that allows connection and disconnection.\n\n We can model the entire system as a part that contains the vehicle and the trailer, and then the connection between them can be made or broken.\n\n But the requirement says the vehicle and trailer are independent and can be connected or disconnected.\n\n We can model the vehicle and trailer as separate parts in a top-level system, and then have an optional connection.\n\n However, SysML does not have an explicit way to model optional connections in the structure without using behavior or states.\n\n Since we are to avoid state machines and events, we can model the connection as a link that can be present or not.\n\n But in the structure, we can only show that they are connectable.\n\n Alternatively, we can have two modes: connected and disconnected, but that might be beyond the current scope.\n\n Given the instructions, we are to produce a structural model that shows the connection mechanism.\n\n We can define a top-level part that contains the vehicle and trailer, and then the connection between the hitch ball and coupler.\n\n However, note that the vehicle and trailer are separate and can be disconnected, meaning that the connection is not permanent.\n\n In SysML, we can model the connection as a connector that can be established and removed.\n\n But in the structural model, we can show that the two ports are compatible and can be connected.\n\n We'll model the top-level system as:\n\n   part def VehicleTrailerSystem {\n      part vehicle : Vehicle;\n      part trailer : Trailer;\n      // This connection can be established when hitched, and removed when unhitched.\n      connect vehicle.hitchBall.hitchingPoint to trailer.coupler.hitchingPoint;\n   }\n\n However, note that when disconnected, the connector is not present. But in the model, we are showing the possibility.\n\n Since the requirement is about the mechanism, we are showing that they are connectable.\n\n Let's write the model accordingly.\n\n We'll use:\n\n   package VehicleTrailerHitchingSystem\n\n   private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n   Then define the port definitions, part definitions, and the top-level system.\n\n We'll keep it simple and avoid any extra complexity.\n\n Let's code accordingly."
