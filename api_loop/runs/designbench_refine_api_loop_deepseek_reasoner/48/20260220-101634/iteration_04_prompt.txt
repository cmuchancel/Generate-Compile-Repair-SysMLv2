You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to implement an automotive cruise control function that enables the driver to set a target speed through the cruise control interface. The vehicle can automatically detect the current speed and, based on the set target speed, automatically adjust the engine output to maintain steady vehicle speed. When the driver sends a set speed command via the cruise control interface, the instruction is transmitted to the vehicle's cruise controller. The vehicle obtains real-time actual speed information via a speed sensor, and the detected speed information is fed back to the cruise controller. The cruise controller compares the set speed with the actual speed and automatically generates corresponding engine fuel control commands, which are sent to the engine to adjust the vehicle's power so that the driving speed remains as close as possible to the target speed set by the driver. Each component of the system exchanges information such as set speed, speed sensing, and fuel control efficiently and accurately via data ports, ensuring simple driver operation and reliable system operation, and effectively fulfilling the requirements for automatic cruise control.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

    private import ScalarValues::*;

    item def Speed {
        attribute value : Real;
    }

    item def FuelCommand {
        attribute value : Real;
    }

    port def SetSpeedPort {
        attribute targetSpeed : Speed;
    }

    port def SpeedSensorPort {
        attribute currentSpeed : Speed;
    }

    port def FuelControlPort {
        attribute command : FuelCommand;
    }

    part def CruiseController {
        port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort;
        port speedSensorIn : SpeedSensorPort;
        port fuelControlOut : FuelControlPort;
    }

    part def CruiseInterface {
        port setSpeedOut : SetSpeedPort;
    }

    part def SpeedSensor {
        port speedOut : SpeedSensorPort;
    }

    part def Engine {
        port fuelControlIn : FuelControlPort;
    }

    part def Vehicle {
        part controller : CruiseController;
        part interface : CruiseInterface;
        part sensor : SpeedSensor;
        part engine : Engine;

        connect interface.setSpeedOut to controller.setSpeedIn;
        connect sensor.speedOut to controller.speedSensorIn;
        connect controller.fuelControlOut to engine.fuelControlIn;
