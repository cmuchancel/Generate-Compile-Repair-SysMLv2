You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to implement a typical Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) message interaction model, supporting message producers to publish messages on specific topics to the server, while consumers can subscribe to topics of interest through the server. The system requires that when a producer publishes a new message, the server is able to promptly receive the published information and, according to the existing topic subscription relationships, distribute and deliver the message to the corresponding subscribers, ensuring that subscribers can accurately and promptly receive the message content of the topics they follow. Users only need to declare the topics they wish to subscribe to, without needing to know the specific publishers or other subscribers. The entire process must feature clear management and efficient processing of message subscription, publishing, and distribution flows.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
