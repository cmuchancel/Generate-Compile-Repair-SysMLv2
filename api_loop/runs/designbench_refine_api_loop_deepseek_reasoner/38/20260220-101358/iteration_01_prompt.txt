You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system shall be capable of managing the vehicle’s start-up, operation, and shutdown processes. When the user issues a vehicle start signal while the vehicle is in the shutdown state, the vehicle should enter the start-up state. Upon receiving a vehicle started signal, the system shall set the vehicle status to running. If the user issues a vehicle shutdown signal during operation, the vehicle status shall return to shutdown. The system must accurately respond to the corresponding signals, enabling automatic switching among the three main states—shutdown, start-up, and running—so that the user can conveniently and safely control the vehicle’s start and stop processes.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
