        "reasoning_content": "We are given a set of requirements for a vehicle system model in SysML v2.\n The goal is to output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.\n We are to use a conservative subset of SysML v2 that is robust with syside.\n\n We are to have a single package and minimal structure, using:\n   package, private import ScalarValues::*, enum def, part def, part, attribute, port def, port, item def, and connect A to B;\n\n We are to avoid: block, property, enumeration, signal def, event def, state machine, stateMachine, transition def, operation def, precondition, postcondition, when, connect A -> B, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.\n\n Let's break down the requirements:\n\n 1. The vehicle system describes a car with a total mass of 2,500 kg.\n 2. The structure comprises front and rear axle assemblies.\n 3. The front axle assembly has a mass of 150 kg and consists of:\n      - two front wheels\n      - a front axle (with properties of mass and steering angle)\n 4. The rear axle assembly has a mass of 250 kg and consists of:\n      - two rear wheels\n      - a rear axle (with a mass property)\n 5. The model aims to illustrate structural relationships and mass distribution.\n\n We are to provide a reference for vehicle structure breakdown and definition of component attributes.\n\n We note that the total mass of the car is 2500 kg, but we are given the masses of the front and rear axle assemblies.\n However, the car also has other parts (like the body, engine, etc.) that are not explicitly mentioned. But the requirement says the structure comprises only front and rear axle assemblies? \n The requirement says: \"whose structure comprises front and rear axle assemblies.\" This might mean that we are only modeling the structural breakdown of the axles? \n\n However, the requirement also says: \"The model aims to illustrate the structural relationships and mass distribution of the vehicle components, providing system engineers with a reference for vehicle structure breakdown and definition of component attributes.\"\n\n We are to model the car as a part with a total mass of 2500 kg, and then have the front and rear axle assemblies as parts within it.\n\n But note: the front axle assembly has a mass of 150 kg and the rear axle assembly has a mass of 250 kg. The remaining mass (2500 - 150 - 250 = 2100 kg) must be accounted for by other parts of the car.\n\n Since the requirement does not specify the other parts, we might have to assume that the car has a body or other components that make up the remaining mass.\n\n However, the requirement only asks for a model that illustrates the structural relationships and mass distribution of the vehicle components, and specifically mentions the front and rear axle assemblies. \n\n We can model the car as having:\n   - a front axle assembly (with given mass and subparts)\n   - a rear axle assembly (with given mass and subparts)\n   - and then a body or other structure to account for the remaining mass.\n\n But the requirement does not specify the body. Alternatively, we can model the car as having the two axle assemblies and then the rest of the car as an unspecified part.\n\n However, the requirement says: \"providing system engineers with a reference for vehicle structure breakdown and definition of component attributes.\" So we are to define the attributes (like mass) for the components.\n\n Let's try to break down:\n\n We can have:\n   - A part definition for the Car, which has attributes for total mass and contains parts for front axle assembly, rear axle assembly, and maybe a body.\n   - However, note that the requirement says the car has a total mass of 2500 kg. We can set the Car's mass attribute to 2500 kg, but then we also have the masses of the subparts. We might want to have an attribute for the mass of the Car and then the sum of the masses of its parts should equal that.\n\n But the requirement does not specify that we must enforce the sum. We are just illustrating.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the Car as a part that has an attribute for total mass and then the front and rear axle assemblies as parts with their own masses. The remaining mass can be left unallocated or assigned to a body part.\n\n Since the requirement does not specify the body, we might choose to not include it and leave the mass of the Car as 2500 kg, with the front and rear axle assemblies having 150 kg and 250 kg respectively, and the rest (2100 kg) unaccounted for in the model. But this might not be a complete structural breakdown.\n\n Alternatively, we can create a part for the body and assign it the remaining mass.\n\n Let's try:\n\n   Car\n     total mass: 2500 kg\n     parts:\n        frontAxleAssembly: FrontAxleAssembly (mass 150 kg)\n        rearAxleAssembly: RearAxleAssembly (mass 250 kg)\n        body: Body (mass 2100 kg)\n\n But the requirement does not mention the body. However, without the body, the Car's structure is only the two axle assemblies, which doesn't make a complete car.\n\n Since the requirement is about illustrating the structural relationships and mass distribution, and specifically mentions the front and rear axle assemblies, we might focus on those and leave the rest as a single body part.\n\n However, the requirement says: \"The model aims to illustrate the structural relationships and mass distribution of the vehicle components\". It does not say we must model every component, but we are to provide a reference for breakdown and attributes.\n\n We'll model the Car with three parts: front axle assembly, rear axle assembly, and body.\n\n But note: the requirement says the car's structure comprises front and rear axle assemblies. This might imply that the body is not considered part of the structure? Or maybe it is, but not specified.\n\n We are in a dilemma.\n\n Let's re-read: \"The vehicle system model describes a car with a total mass of 2,500 kg, whose structure comprises front and rear axle assemblies.\"\n\n This could be interpreted as the car's structure (i.e., the structural part of the car) is made up of the front and rear axle assemblies. This might mean we are only modeling the structural components, and the body might be non-structural? Or maybe the body is included in the structure? \n\n Alternatively, we can model the Car as having two parts: the front axle assembly and the rear axle assembly, and then assign the total mass of the car to an attribute, and then the two axle assemblies have their own masses. The remaining mass (2100 kg) is not modeled, but we can have an attribute for the car's mass and then the two axle assemblies are parts of the car.\n\n However, the requirement says: \"illustrate the structural relationships and mass distribution\". Without the body, the mass distribution is incomplete.\n\n Since the requirement does not specify the body, we might leave it out and note that the car has other components that are not modeled.\n\n But the model is for system engineers to have a reference for structure breakdown and attributes. So we can break down the structure into the two axle assemblies and then leave the rest as an unnamed part? Or we can have a part called \"remainingStructure\" with the remaining mass.\n\n We are allowed to use `part def` and `attribute`.\n\n Let's decide to model the Car with:\n   - an attribute for total mass (2500 kg)\n   - a part for the front axle assembly (with mass 150 kg)\n   - a part for the rear axle assembly (with mass 250 kg)\n   - a part for the body (with mass 2100 kg)\n\n This way, the total mass of the Car is the sum of the masses of its parts, and we have a complete structural breakdown.\n\n However, the requirement does not specify the body. But without it, the model is incomplete.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the Car without the body and just have the two axle assemblies, and then the Car's mass attribute is 2500 kg, and the two axle assemblies have masses that are part of that.\n\n Since the requirement is focused on the axle assemblies, we might model only those and leave the rest of the car as an implicit part.\n\n But the instructions say: \"providing system engineers with a reference for vehicle structure breakdown\". So we should break down the vehicle structure as much as we are given.\n\n Let's go with the explicit body part to account for the remaining mass.\n\n Now, let's break down the front axle assembly:\n   - It has a mass of 150 kg.\n   - It consists of two front wheels and a front axle.\n   - The front axle has properties of mass and steering angle.\n\n We can model:\n   FrontAxleAssembly:\n     attributes:\n        mass: 150 kg (but note, this is the total mass of the assembly, which should be the sum of its parts)\n     parts:\n        leftFrontWheel: FrontWheel\n        rightFrontWheel: FrontWheel\n        frontAxle: FrontAxle\n\n   We need to define the FrontWheel and FrontAxle.\n\n   The FrontAxle has:\n        mass: (we don't know the exact value, but it is part of the 150 kg of the front axle assembly)\n        steeringAngle: some value (we don't know, so we can leave it without a default)\n\n   Similarly, the RearAxleAssembly has:\n        mass: 250 kg\n        parts:\n            leftRearWheel: RearWheel\n            rightRearWheel: RearWheel\n            rearAxle: RearAxle (with mass attribute)\n\n   We need to define RearWheel and RearAxle.\n\n   We are not given the mass of the wheels or the axles individually, so we can leave them as attributes without values, or we can compute them from the assembly mass? But we don't have the breakdown.\n\n   Since the requirement does not specify the individual masses of the wheels and axles, we can leave them as unspecified attributes, or we can assign the entire assembly mass to the axle and zero to the wheels? That doesn't seem right.\n\n   Alternatively, we can model the mass of the assembly as an attribute of the assembly, and then the parts have their own mass attributes, but we don't know the values.\n\n   We can leave the mass of the wheels and axles as attributes without values, and then note that the sum of the parts' masses equals the assembly mass? But we don't have a constraint mechanism in the subset we are using.\n\n   We are only allowed to use simple declarations and connections.\n\n   We can define the FrontAxleAssembly with an attribute for mass (150 kg) and then define the parts without specifying their masses. This would be acceptable as a reference for the structure and the attributes that are needed.\n\n   However, the requirement says: \"providing system engineers with a reference for vehicle structure breakdown and definition of component attributes.\" So we are to define the attributes (like mass and steering angle) for the components, even if we don't have the exact values.\n\n   We can define the attributes without default values.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n   For the front axle assembly, we define it as a part def with an attribute for mass (with value 150 kg) and then parts for the two wheels and the axle.\n\n   But note: the front axle assembly's mass is 150 kg, which is an attribute of the assembly, and the front axle and wheels have their own mass attributes. We are not given how the 150 kg is distributed, so we leave the mass of the axle and wheels without values.\n\n   Similarly for the rear.\n\n   We are also to model the car's body with a mass of 2100 kg.\n\n   We'll use the ScalarValues library for units.\n\n   We are to use `private import ScalarValues::*;` and then we can use units like `kg` and `deg` (for steering angle).\n\n   Let's outline the model:\n\n   Package:\n        private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n        part def Car {\n            attribute totalMass : Real = 2500 kg;\n            part frontAxleAssembly : FrontAxleAssembly;\n            part rearAxleAssembly : RearAxleAssembly;\n            part body : Body;\n        }\n\n        part def Body {\n            attribute mass : Real = 2100 kg;\n        }\n\n        part def FrontAxleAssembly {\n            attribute mass : Real = 150 kg;\n            part leftFrontWheel : FrontWheel;\n            part rightFrontWheel : FrontWheel;\n            part frontAxle : FrontAxle;\n        }\n\n        part def FrontWheel {\n            // We don't have mass specified, so we can leave it without a value, but we know it has mass.\n            attribute mass : Real;\n        }\n\n        part def FrontAxle {\n            attribute mass : Real;\n            attribute steeringAngle : Real; // in degrees? We can use deg from ScalarValues\n        }\n\n        part def RearAxleAssembly {\n            attribute mass : Real = 250 kg;\n            part leftRearWheel : RearWheel;\n            part rightRearWheel : RearWheel;\n            part rearAxle : RearAxle;\n        }\n\n        part def RearWheel {\n            attribute mass : Real;\n        }\n\n        part def RearAxle {\n            attribute mass : Real;\n        }\n\n   We are not connecting the parts because the requirement does not specify connections. We are only doing structural breakdown and mass attributes.\n\n   However, the requirement says: \"illustrate the structural relationships\". The structural relationships are captured by the part definitions (composition).\n\n   We don't need ports or connections for this model because we are only showing the hierarchy and attributes.\n\n   We are to output only the SysMLv2 model.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We are to use `part def` and `attribute` as per the rules.\n\n   We are to avoid `block` and use `part def` instead.\n\n   We are also to use `private import ScalarValues::*;` and then use units.\n\n   We'll create a package for the vehicle system.\n\n   We'll use the following units from ScalarValues: kg, deg.\n\n   Let's write the code."
