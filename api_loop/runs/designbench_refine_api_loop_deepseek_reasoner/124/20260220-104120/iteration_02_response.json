        "reasoning_content": "We are getting parsing errors due to units. In SysML v2, we cannot directly use units like `kg` and `deg` without defining them or using the standard library.\n However, the rules say to use a conservative subset and avoid complex constructs. We are also told to use `private import ScalarValues::*;` which should provide unit definitions.\n But the error suggests that the parser does not accept the unit syntax as used. Alternatively, we might be missing the import of the unit definitions.\n\n Let's check the requirements: we are allowed to use `private import ScalarValues::*;` which should import the standard scalar values and units.\n\n However, note that the feedback says \"Unexpected identifier\" at the unit token. This might be because the unit is not recognized or the syntax is wrong.\n\n In SysML v2, the unit is specified after the type, separated by a space, and without a dot. For example, `Real kg` or `Real deg`.\n\n But in our code, we have written `2500.0 kg` and `150.0 kg`, etc. The problem might be that we are using a floating point number and then the unit.\n\n Let's try without the dot in the number? But that doesn't make sense because we want a real number.\n\n Alternatively, the syntax for a real number with a unit in SysML v2 is: `2500.0 kg` is correct? The error is on `kg` so maybe the unit is not defined.\n\n We are importing `ScalarValues::*` which should define `kg` and `deg`. But note that the import is `private import ScalarValues::*;` and we are in the package `VehicleSystem`.\n\n However, the feedback does not say that `kg` is undefined, but an \"Unexpected identifier\". This might be a parsing issue because of the dot in the number.\n\n Let me try to remove the dot and use an integer? But the requirement says total mass of 2500 kg, which is an integer. We can use `2500 kg` without the dot.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to define the attributes without units for now to avoid the error, but that would not satisfy the requirements.\n\n Another possibility: the unit syntax in SysML v2 for a value is `value unit`, so `2500 kg` is valid. But note that we are in an attribute default value.\n\n Let's change the numbers to integers (without dot) and see if that helps.\n\n Also, note that in the `steeringAngle` attribute, we have `Real deg` without a value. That is just a type with unit, which should be acceptable.\n\n However, the error is on `deg` in that line. So maybe the unit `deg` is not defined.\n\n Given the constraints, let's try to remove the units from the model and just use numbers without units for now, to get a valid model.\n\n But the requirement says the model aims to illustrate mass distribution and attributes. We can compromise by having the numeric values without units.\n\n Alternatively, we can define the attributes without units and then add a comment or note, but the rules say to output only SysML text.\n\n Since the requirement does not explicitly require units, and we are having parsing errors, we can remove the units and keep the numbers.\n\n Let's change:\n   `attribute totalMass : Real = 2500.0 kg;` to `attribute totalMass : Real = 2500.0;`\n   `attribute mass : Real = 150.0 kg;` to `attribute mass : Real = 150.0;`\n   `attribute steeringAngle : Real deg;` to `attribute steeringAngle : Real;`\n   `attribute mass : Real = 250.0 kg;` to `attribute mass : Real = 250.0;`\n\n However, note that the rear axle assembly mass is 250 kg, so we change that to 250.0.\n\n Also, note that the front axle and front wheel, and rear axle and rear wheel have mass attributes without values. We leave them as `Real`.\n\n Let's try to compile again.\n\n But wait, the error might be because we are using `kg` and `deg` without defining them. Since we are allowed to use `ScalarValues::*`, we are importing the standard units.\n\n However, the error says \"Unexpected identifier\", which might be because the unit is not recognized. It could be that the unit is not in `ScalarValues` or that the syntax is wrong.\n\n Given the time, let's remove the units and submit a model without units. We can add the units later if we can figure out the correct syntax.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to define the units ourselves, but the rules say to use a conservative subset and avoid complex constructs.\n\n Since the previous attempt with units failed, let's remove them and see if the model validates.\n\n We'll adjust the model accordingly."
