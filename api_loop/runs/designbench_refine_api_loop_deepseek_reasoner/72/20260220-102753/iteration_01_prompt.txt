You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to analyze the dynamic performance of vehicles, focusing primarily on modeling and calculating the power demand, acceleration, speed, and position variations over time during straight-line driving. Users can set vehicle attributes (such as curb weight, payload, wheel diameter, transmission efficiency, and fuel economy under urban and highway conditions) as well as specific driving cycles (including time-stamped position and speed information) to analyze the required engine power, acceleration, and other dynamic parameters necessary to meet these conditions. Further, the system can calculate the vehicle’s fuel economy throughout the entire driving cycle. It supports compliance verification based on specified energy consumption targets (such as fuel consumption per 100 kilometers or miles per gallon), enabling users to check whether the vehicle can, for example, achieve a fuel economy of over 30 miles per gallon under given scenarios and vehicle configurations. The system features adjustable configuration options, allowing users to conveniently input various vehicle parameters and drive cycle scenarios to facilitate vehicle performance analysis and energy consumption assessment. This provides data support and decision-making references for vehicle design optimization and achievement of energy consumption targets.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
