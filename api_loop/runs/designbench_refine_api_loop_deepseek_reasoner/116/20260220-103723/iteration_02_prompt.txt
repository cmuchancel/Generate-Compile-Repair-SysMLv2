You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to provide configurable capabilities for a modular vehicle platform, supporting the flexible combination and variant selection of different subsystems and components. The system comprises multiple components and subsystems. Users can allocate various components—such as part1, part2, part3 (with port p1), part4, part5 (with port p2 and behavioral variants), and part6—to different subsystems and vehicle configurations according to their requirements. Through the abstract definitions of Subsystem A and Subsystem B, the system respectively supports different variants in terms of the quantity and types of internal components, and allows flexible interconnection between subsystem ports to ensure functional interoperability between Subsystem A and Subsystem B. Configuration schemes, such as VehicleConfigA and VehicleConfigB, support scenario-specific selection and implementation, enabling parameter, behavior, and structural customization at both the subsystem and component levels, while system-level constraints ensure the consistency and rationality of configurations. Ultimately, this system provides a flexible and scalable configuration foundation for the diverse needs of vehicle platforms, enabling end users and engineers to quickly generate vehicle system configurations that meet various functional requirements according to practical use cases.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
