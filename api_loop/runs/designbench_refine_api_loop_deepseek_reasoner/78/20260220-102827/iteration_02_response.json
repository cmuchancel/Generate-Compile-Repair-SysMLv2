The main errors are parsing errors in the enum definitions.\n The error messages indicate that the compiler does not recognize the way we defined the enums.\n\n In SysML v2, the correct way to define an enumeration is with `enum def` and then listing the members without using the `enum` keyword inside.\n However, note that the error message says: \"Unexpected identifier\" at the line of the enum member.\n\n Let's look at the provided example and the feedback:\n\n The previous attempt had:\n   enum def WeatherCondition {\n        Sunny,\n        Rainy,\n        Snowy,\n        Foggy\n    }\n\n The error is at line 13 (Foggy). The issue might be that we are missing a semicolon after each member or that the list of members must be separated by semicolons.\n\n In the SysML v2 textual notation, enum members are defined by listing the names, and they are separated by semicolons, not commas.\n\n Let's change the enum definitions to use semicolons and remove the trailing comma.\n\n Also, note that the error message for the RoadCondition enum is similar.\n\n Let's adjust the enum definitions accordingly.\n\n Additionally, note that the part definitions and other parts might be acceptable, but we must also check the part definitions for multiplicity.\n\n In the `part def Vehicle`, we have:\n   part driver : Driver [0..1];\n   part passengers : Passenger [0..4];\n\n This is correct for multiplicities.\n\n Also, note that in the `TransportationScenario` part, we have multiple connections. The way we wrote the connections is with `connect A to B;` which is correct.\n\n However, note that the compiler feedback was truncated, so we are only addressing the visible errors.\n\n Let's rewrite the model with the corrected enum definitions and without any other changes.\n\n We are also going to keep the same structure and try to be minimal.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Change the enum definitions to use semicolons between members and remove the commas.\n 2. Keep everything else the same.\n\n Let's output the entire model again."
