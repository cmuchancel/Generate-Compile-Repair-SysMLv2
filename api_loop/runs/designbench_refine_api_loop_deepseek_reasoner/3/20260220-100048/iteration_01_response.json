Or we can use part definitions for each component and then have a vehicle part that composes them.\n\n Since we need to support extensibility, we can define a base part definition for VehicleComponent and then specific components as specializations.\n\n However, note: the requirement says \"These components are all subclasses of vehicle components.\" So we can have a base type.\n\n We are to use part definitions and parts.\n\n We can do:\n\n   package VehicleStructure {\n        private import ScalarValues::*;\n\n        part def VehicleComponent {\n            // common attributes for all components?\n        }\n\n        part def Engine :> VehicleComponent {\n            // engine specific attributes\n        }\n\n        part def Transmission :> VehicleComponent {\n            // transmission specific attributes\n        }\n\n        part def Wheel :> VehicleComponent {\n            // wheel specific attributes\n        }\n\n        part def Vehicle {\n            // parts with multiplicity\n            part engine : Engine[1];\n            part transmission : Transmission[1];\n            part wheels : Wheel[4];\n        }\n   }\n\n But note: the requirement says \"a vehicle must be equipped with exactly four wheels, as well as one engine and one transmission.\"\n\n We can use multiplicities in the part definitions.\n\n However, note that we are to use `part` inside a part definition to represent composition.\n\n Let me try to write the model accordingly.\n\n We are also to use `item def` if needed, but I don't see a need for it in the initial model.\n\n Let me write the model.\n\n Important: We are to avoid `block` and use `part def` instead.\n\n We are also to use `private import ScalarValues::*;` for basic types.\n\n We'll use simple attribute declarations if needed.\n\n Let's write the code."
