You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to manage and control the start-up, operation, health monitoring, and related automatic control logic of a vehicle (VehicleA). The vehicle should support multiple operating states, including Off, Starting, Running, and Health Management states. During the start-up process, the vehicle can only transition from the Off state to the Starting state when the brake pedal is pressed and a start signal is received; subsequently, it enters the Running state upon receiving a vehicle-on signal. Once switched to the Running state, the system will automatically perform self-checks, supply power to the vehicle, and automatically apply the parking brake when exiting this state. The system also features self-perception of health, being capable of real-time detection and output of the vehicle’s temperature; when the temperature exceeds a safety threshold, the system will switch the vehicle to a degraded mode and send an over-temperature signal to the controller. The system also supports Maintenance and Degraded states, and can return to the Normal state upon receipt of a restore-to-normal signal. Meanwhile, the vehicle controller has its own operation state management and can switch the vehicle’s main control states in response to start-up and shut-down signals. The design of this system emphasizes automated response, health monitoring, and safety control to ensure that the vehicle operates in a safe, controllable, and maintainable state.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
