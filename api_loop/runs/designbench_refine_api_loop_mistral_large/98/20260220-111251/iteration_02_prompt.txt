You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system shall be capable of managing fuel flow, ensuring that fuel can be delivered from the fuel tank to the engine and supporting fuel return. During operation, the system shall monitor and manage the temperature of the fuel and realize fuel supply and return through fuel interfaces. The fuel tank and the engine shall be connected via standardized fuel interfaces to ensure the reliability and safety of fuel flow.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package FuelManagementSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def FuelFlowDirection {
        enum supply;
        enum return;
    }

    part def FuelTank {
        attribute capacity : Real;
        port fuelSupplyPort : FuelInterface;
        port fuelReturnPort : FuelInterface;
    }

    part def Engine {
        port fuelSupplyPort : FuelInterface;
        port fuelReturnPort : FuelInterface;
        attribute fuelTemperature : Real;
    }

    port def FuelInterface {
        attribute direction : FuelFlowDirection;
    }

    part def FuelSystem {
        part tank : FuelTank;
        part engine : Engine;

        connect tank.fuelSupplyPort to engine.fuelSupplyPort;
        connect engine.fuelReturnPort to tank.fuelReturnPort;
    }

    item def Fuel {
        attribute temperature : Real;
    }
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.
