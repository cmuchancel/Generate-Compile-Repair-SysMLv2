You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system mainly includes two types of vehicles: small vehicles and large vehicles. Each type is equipped with an engine, and each engine consists of several cylinders. The engine of a small vehicle has 4 cylinders, while the engine of a large vehicle has 6 cylinders. Each cylinder, as a fundamental component of the engine, plays a key role in the engine's normal operation and the vehicle’s power output. This design supports engine configurations with 4 to 6 cylinders to meet the performance requirements of different vehicle types.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 4):
                package VehicleSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    part def Vehicle;
    part def Engine;
    part def Cylinder;

    part def SmallVehicle :> Vehicle {
        part engine : Engine {
            part cylinders : Cylinder[4];
        }
    }

    part def LargeVehicle :> Vehicle {
        part engine : Engine {
            part cylinders : Cylinder[6];
        }
    }

    attribute def CylinderCount : Integer;
}

SYSIDE COMPILER FEEDBACK TO ADDRESS:
            iteration_04.sysml:20:33: error (parsing-error): Expected a token. Did you forget ';'?
20 |     attribute def CylinderCount : Integer;

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
