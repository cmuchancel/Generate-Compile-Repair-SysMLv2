You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used to verify and validate the parameters of the car headlamp tilt adjustment knob, ensuring that the adjusted beam tilt angle falls within a reasonable range. Specifically, the tilt angle of the headlamp beam (measured in degrees) must be between 50 degrees and 80 degrees; any value outside this range does not comply with safety and regulatory standards. The system adopts the International System of Units (SI) and standard real number constants (such as pi and Euler’s number e) to ensure precision and consistency in calculations, thereby achieving scientific and reliable management of the headlamp beam adjustment knob functionality.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package HeadlampTiltAdjustment {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def TiltAngleStatus {
        enum IN_RANGE
        enum BELOW_MIN
        enum ABOVE_MAX
    }

    part def HeadlampTiltKnob {
        attribute minAngle : Real = 50.0;
        attribute maxAngle : Real = 80.0;
        attribute currentAngle : Real;
        attribute status : TiltAngleStatus;
    }

    part def TiltAngleValidator {
        port validate : ValidationPort;
    }

    port def ValidationPort {
        in angle : Real;
        out status : TiltAngleStatus;
    }

    part tiltKnob : HeadlampTiltKnob;
    part validator : TiltAngleValidator;

    connect tiltKnob.currentAngle to validator.validate.angle;
    connect validator.validate.status to tiltKnob.status;
}
