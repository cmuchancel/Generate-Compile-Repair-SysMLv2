You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to manage the connection status between a vehicle and a trailer. The system includes one vehicle and one trailer. The vehicle is equipped with a chassis and a tow ball, while the trailer features a coupler and a trailer frame. The system enables the vehicle to connect to or disconnect from the trailer by means of the tow ball on the vehicle’s chassis and the coupler on the trailer’s frame, thus facilitating the hitching and unhitching operations between the trailer and the vehicle. Users can conveniently connect or disconnect the trailer via the system, ensuring that the trailer can be safely and reliably coupled to the vehicle when needed, and can be smoothly detached when not required, thereby enhancing the convenience and safety of vehicle-trailer combinations.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package VehicleTrailerConnectionSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def ConnectionStatus {
        enum connected;
        enum disconnected;
    }

    part def Vehicle {
        attribute chassis : Chassis;
        attribute towBall : TowBall;
        attribute connectionStatus : ConnectionStatus = ConnectionStatus::disconnected;
    }

    part def Trailer {
        attribute frame : TrailerFrame;
        attribute coupler : Coupler;
    }

    part def Chassis;
    part def TowBall;
    part def TrailerFrame;
    part def Coupler;

    part vehicle : Vehicle;
    part trailer : Trailer;

    connect vehicle.towBall to trailer.coupler;
}

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
