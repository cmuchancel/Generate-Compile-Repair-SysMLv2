You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed for automatic monitoring and control of the battery charging process, ensuring that the battery can be safely and efficiently fully charged. The battery charging control system needs to monitor the current battery level in real time, automatically supplying charge when the battery level is below 100%; when the battery level reaches or exceeds 100%, the charging process is automatically terminated without manual intervention. The core functions of this system include battery capacity monitoring, automatic charging, and charging termination control, aiming to ensure healthy charging of the battery and to enhance convenience and safety of use.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

    part def Battery {
        attribute capacity : Real;
        attribute currentLevel : Real = 0.0;
        attribute isCharging : Boolean = false;
        port batteryPort : BatteryPort;
    }

    part def Charger {
        port powerOut : PowerPort;
    }

    port def PowerPort {
    }

    port def BatteryPort {
    }

    part def ChargingController {
        attribute currentState : ChargingState = ChargingState::IDLE;
        attribute threshold : Real = 100.0;

        port batteryPort : BatteryPort;
        port chargerPort : PowerPort;
    }

    part system {

        part controller : ChargingController;

        connect controller.batteryPort to battery.batteryPort;
        connect controller.chargerPort to charger.powerOut;
    }

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
