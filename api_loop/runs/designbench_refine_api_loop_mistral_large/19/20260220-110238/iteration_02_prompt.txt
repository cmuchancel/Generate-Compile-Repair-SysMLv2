You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to support the photography workflow, enabling the complete process from focusing on a scene to producing the final image. The user first selects or sets a scene to be photographed; the system then automatically performs focusing on the selected scene and generates an intermediate image. Subsequently, the system carries out the shooting operation based on the focused image, thereby outputting the final photograph. The entire workflow is completed sequentially through the two steps of “Focusing” and “Shooting,” ensuring that the image has achieved clear focus before shooting and resulting in high-quality photo output. The system operation process is concise and coherent, enabling users to efficiently obtain the desired photographs.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package PhotographyWorkflow {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def FocusStatus {
        enum Unfocused;
        enum Focused;
    }

    part def Scene {
        attribute description : String;
    }

    part def Camera {
        attribute focusStatus : FocusStatus = FocusStatus::Unfocused;
        attribute intermediateImage : Image;
        attribute finalImage : Image;

        port def focusPort;
        port def shootPort;
        port focus : focusPort;
        port shoot : shootPort;
    }

    part def Image {
        attribute data : Blob;
    }

    part def Workflow {
        part scene : Scene;
        part camera : Camera;

        attribute currentStep : String;
    }

    item def FocusCommand;
    item def ShootCommand;
    item def ImageData;

    part workflow : Workflow;

    connect workflow.camera.focus to workflow.scene;
    connect workflow.camera.shoot to workflow.camera.focus;
}
