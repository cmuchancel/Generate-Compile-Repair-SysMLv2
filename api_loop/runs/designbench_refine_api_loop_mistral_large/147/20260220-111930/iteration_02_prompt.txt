You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to support the modeling and management requirements of alloy-related properties and their constituent metals in the field of materials science. The system can define and manage the basic characteristics of different substances, materials, and metals, such as atomic mass, and can clearly represent the mass fractions of component materials in alloys. In addition, the system supports standardized modeling of important mechanical properties—for example, tensile strength—allowing the use of derived SI units (such as newtons per square millimeter) for expression. The same alloy can be composed of two or more materials combined according to specified mass fractions, and the system provides detailed recording of each component material, its mass fraction, and the overall tensile strength of the alloy. The system enables the creation of instances for common metals (such as iron, carbon, manganese) and typical alloys (such as steel 980), assigning scientific units and real or standard values to their properties. With this system, users can conveniently view, edit, and expand the composition and property data of metallic materials and alloys, thus providing a data foundation and support for scenarios such as scientific research, engineering design, and quality control.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
