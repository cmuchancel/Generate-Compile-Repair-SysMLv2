You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is used to control the vehicle’s start-stop process. The vehicle is initially in the off state. Upon receiving a "start signal," it enters the start process. During startup, the system will only respond to the "power-on signal" after detecting that the brake pedal has been depressed, and will simultaneously send a start signal to the controller. Once the vehicle enters the operating state, it will automatically perform a self-check and continuously supply power to the vehicle. When a "stop signal" is received, the process returns the vehicle to the off state. Upon leaving the operating state, the parking brake will be automatically applied to ensure parking safety. The overall system is designed to ensure the safety and reliability of the vehicle’s start-stop process, as well as coordinated control with the controller.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package VehicleStartStopSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def StartStopState {
        enum off;
        enum starting;
        enum operating;
    }

    part def VehicleController;

    part def BrakePedal {
        attribute isDepressed : Boolean;
    }

    part def ParkingBrake {
        attribute isApplied : Boolean;
    }

    port def StartSignalPort;
    port def PowerOnSignalPort;
    port def StopSignalPort;
    port def ControllerSignalPort;

    item def StartSignal;
    item def PowerOnSignal;
    item def StopSignal;
    item def ControllerCommand;

    part def VehicleStartStopSystem {
        attribute state : StartStopState = StartStopState::off;

        part brakePedal : BrakePedal;
        part parkingBrake : ParkingBrake;
        part controller : VehicleController;

        port startSignalPort : StartSignalPort;
        port powerOnSignalPort : PowerOnSignalPort;
        port stopSignalPort : StopSignalPort;
        port controllerSignalPort : ControllerSignalPort;
    }

    connect VehicleStartStopSystem::startSignalPort to VehicleStartStopSystem::controllerSignalPort;
    connect VehicleStartStopSystem::powerOnSignalPort to VehicleStartStopSystem::controllerSignalPort;
    connect VehicleStartStopSystem::stopSignalPort to VehicleStartStopSystem::parkingBrake;
}
