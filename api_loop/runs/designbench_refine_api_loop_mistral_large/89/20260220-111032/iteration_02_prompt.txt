You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed for modeling and managing risks and failures. It is capable of identifying and describing various possible situations, the causes leading to their occurrence, and the potential failures that may result. The system should be able to record the probability of each cause and the severity level of each failure. By establishing causal relationships, it analyzes the sequence and impact mechanisms among different situations. In addition, the system should support comprehensive modeling of different risk scenarios, enabling users to evaluate and manage potential risks and failures in an all-round manner. This provides a basis for risk control and decision-making.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Revise the earlier model to resolve the diagnostics without undoing correct structure.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
