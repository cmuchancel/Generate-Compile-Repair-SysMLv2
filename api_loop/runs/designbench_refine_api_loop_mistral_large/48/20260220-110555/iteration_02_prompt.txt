You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system aims to implement an automotive cruise control function that enables the driver to set a target speed through the cruise control interface. The vehicle can automatically detect the current speed and, based on the set target speed, automatically adjust the engine output to maintain steady vehicle speed. When the driver sends a set speed command via the cruise control interface, the instruction is transmitted to the vehicle's cruise controller. The vehicle obtains real-time actual speed information via a speed sensor, and the detected speed information is fed back to the cruise controller. The cruise controller compares the set speed with the actual speed and automatically generates corresponding engine fuel control commands, which are sent to the engine to adjust the vehicle's power so that the driving speed remains as close as possible to the target speed set by the driver. Each component of the system exchanges information such as set speed, speed sensing, and fuel control efficiently and accurately via data ports, ensuring simple driver operation and reliable system operation, and effectively fulfilling the requirements for automatic cruise control.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (iteration 1):
                package CruiseControlSystem {
    private import ScalarValues::*;

    enum def SpeedUnit {
        enum kmph;
        enum mph;
    }

    part def SpeedSensor {
        attribute currentSpeed : Real;
        attribute unit : SpeedUnit = SpeedUnit::kmph;
        port speedOut : SpeedDataPort;
    }

    part def CruiseControlInterface {
        port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort;
        port speedDisplayOut : SpeedDisplayPort;
    }

    part def CruiseController {
        port setSpeedIn : SetSpeedPort;
        port actualSpeedIn : SpeedDataPort;
        port fuelControlOut : FuelControlPort;
    }

    part def Engine {
        port fuelControlIn : FuelControlPort;
    }

    port def SetSpeedPort {
        attribute targetSpeed : Real;
        attribute unit : SpeedUnit = SpeedUnit::kmph;
    }

    port def SpeedDataPort {
        attribute speedValue : Real;
        attribute unit : SpeedUnit = SpeedUnit::kmph;
    }

    port def FuelControlPort {
        attribute fuelCommand : Real;
    }

    port def SpeedDisplayPort {
        attribute displayedSpeed : Real;
        attribute unit : SpeedUnit = SpeedUnit::kmph;
    }

    part vehicle :> part {
        part speedSensor : SpeedSensor;
        part cruiseInterface : CruiseControlInterface;
        part cruiseController : CruiseController;
        part engine : Engine;

        connect cruiseInterface.setSpeedIn to cruiseController.setSpeedIn;
        connect speedSensor.speedOut to cruiseController.actualSpeedIn;
        connect cruiseController.fuelControlOut to engine.fuelControlIn;
    }
