You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system needs to support a structured description of tire information. Each tire entry should include the manufacturer name, rim diameter, tire width, as well as optional installation position information (i.e., a coordinate vector in three-dimensional space). The rim diameter should be expressed in inches, which is the commonly used unit in the United States. The system should be able to distinguish between tires from different manufacturers and with different specifications, for example, a French Michelin brand tire with an 18-inch rim diameter and a width of 245, and be able to record all the aforementioned attributes completely. At the same time, the system should possess data scalability to accommodate future additions of other brands, sizes, and installation information.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
