You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The engineering materials database system should be capable of modeling and managing various types of engineering materials, including metals and their alloys. The system should support the description of fundamental properties of materials, such as atomic mass, compositional information, and mechanical property indicators. For metals and alloys, the system must be able to define their detailed compositional information, including the mass fraction of each constituent material. Regarding mechanical properties, the system should support standardized and dimensional management of parameters such as tensile strength, and be able to represent and convert them using commonly used engineering units (e.g., Newtons per square millimeter). Taking high-strength steel Steel_980 as an example, the system should accurately record the mass fractions of its components such as iron, carbon, and manganese, as well as its overall tensile strength, to facilitate subsequent material selection, evaluation, and application. Overall, the system aims to provide end users with an intuitive, standardized, and flexible data management approach, enabling convenient data entry, querying, and comparison of engineering materials, thereby improving the efficiency and scientific rigor of materials engineering research, development, and application.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
