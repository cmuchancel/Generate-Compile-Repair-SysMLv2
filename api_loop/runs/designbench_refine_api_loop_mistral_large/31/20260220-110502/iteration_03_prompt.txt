You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to simulate a vehicle with a known mass moving along a one-dimensional straight path, predicting its position over time based on a given time-varying power input sequence. Users are required to provide the vehicle's mass, initial position, initial velocity, the time interval of each simulation step, as well as the power input at each time step. The system sequentially calculates the vehicle's speed and position at each moment according to the input data, and outputs the trajectory of the vehicle's position at each time step. This helps users analyze the vehicle's motion behavior under different power inputs.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.
