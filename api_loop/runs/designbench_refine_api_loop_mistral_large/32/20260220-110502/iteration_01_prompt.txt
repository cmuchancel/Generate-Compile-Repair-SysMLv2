You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
This system is designed to implement basic camera shooting and display functionality. While framing, the user can input the current scene into the system. The system first performs a focusing process on the scene to obtain an image; then, it captures the obtained image to generate a photo. Finally, the system automatically displays the captured photo on the screen, allowing the user to view the shooting result immediately. The entire process ensures that scene processing, image generation, and photo display are seamlessly and automatically integrated. The user only needs to perform a simple shooting operation to obtain a complete experience of photographing and viewing the result.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
