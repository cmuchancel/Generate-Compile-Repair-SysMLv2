You are generating SysML v2 text in a compile-fix loop.

REQUIREMENTS:
The system requires the power transmission system to provide power and generate torque. In the logical model, the system possesses the capability to deliver power and generate torque, which is specifically realized through the action of "generating torque" by the torque generator component, enabling the transfer and conversion of power. In the physical model, the powertrain includes the engine as a component, and the engine actually performs the function of generating torque. Ultimately, the model specifies that the logical-layer torque generator is to be allocated to the physical powertrain component, with the specific operation of generating torque further allocated to the engine within the powertrain. The system as a whole must ensure, through the above division and allocation, effective generation and management of power and torque to meet the practical requirements for power output during vehicle operation.

Goal: output a SysML v2 model that validates and satisfies the requirements.

Rules: output only SysML text with no prose or markdown; prioritize fixing validator errors first; if a previous candidate is provided, apply minimal edits and preserve valid parts.

Use a conservative subset that is robust with syside: `package`, `private import ScalarValues::*`, `enum def` with `enum` members, `part def`, `part`, `attribute`, `port def`, `port`, `item def`, and `connect A to B;`.

Prefer simple declarations: `attribute name : Type;` or `attribute name : Type = Value;`. Keep a single package and minimal structure.

Avoid constructs that frequently fail validation: `block`, `property`, `enumeration`, `signal def`, `event def`, `state machine`, `stateMachine`, `transition def`, `operation def`, `precondition`, `postcondition`, `when`, `connect A -> B`, and quoted pseudo-code constraints.

Return only the updated SysMLv2 model.
