\begin{abstract}
SysMLv2 is a textual, compilable modeling language, so generated output is only useful if it passes deterministic compiler checks. One-shot large language model generation frequently produces plausible but uncompilable SysMLv2, motivating compiler-gated refinement rather than one-pass synthesis.

This paper studies a syntax-only compiler-in-the-loop pipeline on the full SysMBench prompt set (IDs 1--151), evaluated across four model configurations. For each prompt/model trial, we compare baseline single-shot output (iteration 1 only) against the final output after iterative generate--compile--repair using \texttt{syside check} as the oracle. Across 604 trials, first-shot compilation succeeds on 51.16\% (309/604; 95\% Wilson CI: 47.18--55.13\%), while the compiler-in-the-loop final output reaches 100.00\% eventual compilation (604/604; 95\% Wilson CI: 99.37--100.00\%), a gain of 48.84 percentage points with zero unresolved prompts. Failed-first-shot cases recover fully (295/295). These results show that deterministic compiler feedback is the primary control signal for reliable natural-language--to--SysMLv2 generation and that single-shot generation leaves a large, recoverable syntactic error surface.

%%%%%%%%%  BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) relies on formal, machine-checkable artifacts to support early design iteration, requirements traceability, and verification. The release of Systems Modeling Language version~2 (SysMLv2)~\cite{omgSysMLv2Spec2024} strengthens this workflow...
  strengthens this workflow by introducing a fully textual modeling language with a well-defined grammar and an executable toolchain, enabling models to be parsed, compiled, and version-controlled like software.

This shift creates an opportunity for automated model synthesis: engineers could describe a system in natural language and obtain a SysMLv2 model that can be compiled and analyzed. Large language models (LLMs) are a natural candidate for this translation task, given their success at generating structured code from natural-language specifications. However, a model that is ``almost correct'' is not useful in practice: even small syntax or metamodel errors prevent compilation and therefore block rendering, visualization, and downstream analysis. Reliable translation therefore requires \emph{syntactic validity}, not just plausible-looking output.

The current status quo is that LLMs can often produce readable pseudo-code or SysML-like text. Pseudo-code is not sufficient for MBSE: SysML is intended to serve as a \emph{compilable} and \emph{visualizable} system representation, and compilation is the gateway to rendering, visualization, and analysis inside engineering toolchains. If an LLM output is not syntactically correct, it cannot be compiled and therefore cannot be rendered into the diagrams and model views that engineers use to understand and communicate system structure and behavior. As a result, the practical value of AI-assisted modeling hinges on producing syntactically valid SysMLv2, not informal approximations.

In many code-generation domains, syntactic reliability can be improved by training or fine-tuning on large corpora of valid programs. For SysMLv2, such data is currently scarce: there is no large, broadly available dataset of compiler-verified models, and the language itself is evolving. Consequently, one-shot LLM generations often mix SysML~v1 patterns with SysMLv2 constructs or violate the SysMLv2 grammar, leading to outputs that read convincingly but fail deterministic checks. This data scarcity motivates a method that improves correctness \emph{without} modifying model weights.

This paper presents a compiler-in-the-loop framework that couples an off-the-shelf LLM with a deterministic verifier in an iterative generate--compile--repair loop. At each iteration, the model proposes a complete SysMLv2 candidate; the verifier returns precise diagnostics (error types and locations); and a controller converts these diagnostics into targeted revision instructions. The loop terminates only when zero errors are reported, yielding syntactic validity by construction without training, fine-tuning, or specialized hardware.

We evaluate the approach on all 151 SysMBench prompts and compare two conditions for each prompt/model pair: single-shot compilation at iteration 1 versus final compilation after compiler-in-the-loop refinement. Results show that deterministic compiler feedback is the primary driver of dependable generation: iterative refinement converts many first-pass failures into compilable SysMLv2 while single-shot generation alone leaves a large recoverable error surface.

\section{Related Work}

Our review focuses on prior efforts in automated SysML v2 generation, grammar-constrained structured synthesis, and compiler-guided iterative refinement, with an emphasis on approaches addressing reliable syntactic correctness in low-data modeling languages.

\subsection{LLM-Based SysML v2 Model Generation}
Recent work has explored using large language models to generate SysML v2 models from natural language. Bouamra et al.~\cite{bouamra2025systemp} propose SysTemp, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the generation task into requirement extraction, template-based skeleton construction, and grammar-level parsing feedback. Their system employs a ParserAgent to detect syntactic errors and iteratively repair generated models, achieving 80\% convergence across five evaluation scenarios. This work demonstrates that structural scaffolding and agent decomposition improve grammar conformity in sparse-data settings. However, syntactic correctness is defined at the grammar level and convergence is reported empirically rather than enforced as a termination invariant.

Cibrián et al.~\cite{cibrian2025sysmlagent} introduce an agent-based framework combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with ANTLR-based grammar validation for SysML v2 synthesis. Their approach reports 100\% syntactic validity across 20 curated prompts under grammar-level parsing. While this represents a significant advance in structured generation reliability, correctness is enforced through grammar parsing rather than full compiler validation. Because grammar-level validation ensures context-free structural conformity but does not enforce full static semantics under the official toolchain, grammar-valid models may still fail compilation in production environments.
neccessary but not sufficient
Together, these efforts establish that iterative validation substantially improves syntactic success in SysML v2 generation. However, prior systems define correctness at the grammar level and evaluate on limited scenario sets. Our work builds on these insights while shifting the correctness oracle from grammar parsing to the official SysIDE compiler and scaling evaluation to benchmark-level scenarios.

\subsection{Grammar-Constrained and Template-Based Structured Synthesis}

Structured synthesis approaches aim to reduce hallucinations in LLM output by constraining generation via templates or grammar rules. SysTemp~\cite{bouamra2025systemp} explicitly uses a template generator based on Jinja2 to construct syntactically compliant model skeletons prior to completion. Grammar-constrained decoding and post-generation parsing similarly reduce token-level structural invalidity.

While grammar validation ensures adherence to context-free rules, it does not enforce type resolution, cross-reference integrity, constraint satisfaction, or toolchain compatibility. Thus, grammar-valid artifacts may remain unusable within industrial MBSE workflows. Our approach differs by treating grammar conformity as necessary but insufficient and requiring full compiler acceptance prior to termination.

\subsection{Compiler-in-the-Loop and Verifier-Guided Generation}

Prior work in neural code generation has explored leveraging compiler diagnostics to improve the compilability of model outputs. For example, Wang et al.~\cite{wang2022compilable} propose a multi-stage refinement framework that uses compiler feedback to iteratively revise generated programs and increase compilation success rates. Such approaches demonstrate that deterministic compiler signals can serve as effective supervisory feedback in programming-language settings. However, these systems operate in mature programming ecosystems and treat compilation success as an empirical objective rather than as a structural termination invariant.

Beyond compiler-feedback approaches in code generation, iterative generation guided by deterministic verifiers has also been studied under counterexample-guided inductive synthesis and execution-based refinement paradigms. Grubišić et al.~\cite{grubisic2024compiler} demonstrate that LLVM compiler feedback can serve as a supervisory signal for refining LLM-generated intermediate representation. Their work shows that deterministic compilation signals constrain output space and improve structural validity in programming languages.

While these approaches establish the feasibility of compiler-aware refinement in software domains, they differ in both objective and context from model-based systems engineering. Compiler feedback in such systems is typically used to improve optimization quality or increase compilation probability, rather than to enforce strict termination conditions. Moreover, these methods operate in programming languages with extensive training corpora and stable ecosystems.

In contrast, our work applies compiler-in-the-loop refinement to SysMLv2, a newly standardized modeling language with sparse representation in LLM training data and strict toolchain requirements. Rather than treating compilation results as heuristic feedback, we enforce zero-error compilation under the SysMLv2 compiler (invoked via \texttt{syside check}) as a termination invariant. This elevates syntactic correctness from an empirical metric to a property guaranteed by construction, aligning generation reliability with production MBSE toolchain criteria rather than grammar-level approximations.

\section{Discussion}
We discuss why deterministic compiler diagnostics provide an effective supervision signal for new, sparsely represented languages like SysMLv2, and the resulting trade-offs in runtime and number of iterations.

\section{Conclusion}
We present a reproducible pathway for reliable natural-language to SysMLv2 translation by embedding deterministic compiler feedback into LLM generation, thereby guaranteeing syntactically valid (compilable) output by construction.

\section{Referring to Citations, Figures, and Equations}

Citations are automatically numbered \cite{ning2002}. They should be inserted in the text using a \verb|\cite{ref}| command~\cite{gibson2008,stevens1999}. The citations will be automatically sorted and compressed if they are given in a set \cite{stevens1999,ning2002,gibson2008,wions2005,smith2002,watson1982}. 
A specific reference may be named with an abbreviation, as in Ref.~\cite{watson1982}.
See the \texttt{asmeconf-sample.bib} file and Sect.~\ref{sec:references} for examples of entering references.

For ASME conference papers, the labels Equation and Figure should be abbreviated when they do not start a sentence, as in  Eq.~\eqref{eqn:dw} and Fig.~\ref{fig:1}. Figure~\ref{fig:1} is spelled out when it starts a sentence. Equation~\eqref{eqn:dw} is spelled out when it starts a sentence. 

Equations are typeset in the usual way and will be automatically numbered.  The class file loads the \texttt{amsmath} and \texttt{mathtools} packages. Further, the \texttt{newtxmath} package used for the math fonts includes many additional math features (see Sect.~\ref{sec:moremath}).
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fourier}
\vec{q} = -k\nabla T
\end{equation}

ASME prefers SI units. (U.S.\ style units may follow in parentheses.) Be sure to put all symbols into the nomenclature list, including their units.

\section{Section Headings and Captions}

ASME requires that section headings and captions be set in an uppercase, sans serif font.  The class will do this automatically.  You can place \verb|\cite{..}|, \verb|\ref{..}|, \verb|\label{..}|, and mathematics into headings and captions directly, as you would in the main text. Do not enclose them braces, e.g.\ \verb|{\cite{..}}|, which will cause errors. You can place \verb|\footnote{..}| into headings, but not into captions.\footnote{See \texttt{tex-stackexchange} for various approaches to footnotes in captions, if they seem necessary. For footnotes in tables, use the \texttt{tablefootnote} package.}\footnote{Sequential footnotes are automatically separated by a comma.}

Text in section headings and captions will not be capitalized if enclosed in a \verb|\NoCaseChange{..}| command.

Sections may either be numbered or left unnumbered.

Simple mathematical expressions can be used in either captions or section headings. For a section heading that includes more complicated math (and macros), you may use the optional argument of \verb|\section[..]{..}| to create a pdf bookmark without losing characters or producing warnings or errors. See the \texttt{asmeconf-template.tex} source file for examples of this procedure. These bookmarks should usually be text expressions, although some math is supported.  

To eliminate boldface type in caption text and math, use the class option \texttt{[unboldcaption]}.  To prevent sans-serif math, put \verb|\NoCaseChange{\mathversion{normal}}| in the caption.

\subsection{Subsection and Sub-subsection Headings}

Subsections and sub-subsection headings should be entered in title case, with the first letter of primary words capitalized. Sub-subsections (i.e., paragraphs) are never numbered.

\section{Tables and Figures}

Table \ref{tab:1} is an example of a simple table. Table captions should be placed above tables.
The class loads the \texttt{booktabs} package (used for horizontal rules in Tables \ref{tab:1} and \ref{tab:2}), and the \texttt{array} and \texttt{dcolumn} packages which provide extended capabilities for columns in the \texttt{tabular} environment (see Table \ref{tab:2}).  Table \ref{tab:3} is an example of a table that spans two columns. Two column tables (and figures) will always float to the top of a later page.

Figure captions go below figures. Figure~\ref{fig:2} is an example of a figure that spans two columns and includes subfigures. The text in figures (and tables) should be no smaller than 6~point type. Images in figures are handled by the standard \texttt{graphicx} package.

Landscape figures and tables may be produced at full-page size by putting \verb|\usepackage[figuresright]{rotating}| in your \texttt{.tex} file's preamble and using the \texttt{sidewaystable*} and \texttt{sidewaysfigure*} environments~\cite{fairbairns}.

\section{Reference Formatting with \NoCaseChange{\texttt{asmeconf.bst}}\footnote{To prevent capitalization of text in a section heading or caption, such as an SI unit, enclose it in a \texttt{\textbackslash NoCaseChange} command. As of the July 2022 release of \LaTeX, commands used in a heading or caption may be protected globally by putting this in the preamble: \texttt{\textbackslash AddToNoCaseChangeList\{\textbackslash MyCommand\}}}}\label{sec:references}

The {\upshape\texttt{asmeconf.bst}} \BibTeX\   style follows the reference styles shown on ASME's conference web site in  2025.\footnote{\texttt{asmeconf.bst} is intended as a replacement for the old \texttt{asmems4.bst}, which does not follow ASME's current reference formats or support DOI and URL.}
Examples for these and many other cases are given in the \texttt{asmeconf-sample.bib} file, which is part of this distribution. Citations and references are managed by the standard \texttt{natbib} package.  Nevertheless, a few comments are necessary. 

%% sub-subsections should *not* be numbered according to ASME's style

\subsubsection*{DOI, URL, and eprint} Include DOI numbers when they are available.  URL's may alternatively be given. ASME requests that URLs point to a document's abstract.

Basic support for \texttt{eprint} numbers is also included, generating a url at the end of the citation. The \texttt{archive} type may be specified using the macros \texttt{arxiv, google\-books, hdl, jstore, oclc}, or \texttt{pubmed} (e.g., \texttt{archive=hdl},  \emph{without} braces). Both \texttt{eprint} and \texttt{archive} fields \emph{must} be given. Other root urls may be invoked using \verb|archive = {https://another.url.org/}|.

\subsubsection*{Online Sources} A bibliography entry \verb|@online{..| is included for citation of online sources, such as web pages. A \texttt{url} or \texttt{eprint} with \texttt{archive} must be included. See the examples of use in the \texttt{asmeconf-sample.bib} file. 

\subsubsection*{Date Accessed} The \verb|urldate={..}| field may be used to provide the date on which a given url was accessed. By default, the text printed will be \texttt{Accessed `date',}. The word ``Accessed'' may be changed using the \verb|urltype={..}| field.

\subsubsection*{Conference Location and Date} To specify the city and date of a conference, you can use \verb|venue={..}| and \verb|eventdate={..}| with the entries \verb|@inproceeedings{..| and \verb|@proceeedings{..|

\subsubsection*{Capitalization of Titles} ASME's bibliography style requires that document titles be in title case. The first letters of principal words are capitalized. Do this in the \texttt{.bib} file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  MORE ON MATH   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Here is an example of managing complicated math in a section or subsection heading: 
%%    the optional argument to \section will provide the pdf bookmark
%%    without losing most characters or producing warnings/errors.
%%
%% In this heading, letter u is forced to be upright with \mathrm{u}
%%
\section[More on math: u*omega=0]{More on math: $\vec{\mathrm{u}}\cdot\vec{\omega}=0$}\label{sec:moremath}

In most cases, the need for a wide equation can be eliminated by using one of the multiline equation environments defined by 
\texttt{amsmath}, such as \texttt{align}, \texttt{split}, or \texttt{multline}~\cite{amsmath}. The following equation is set with the 
\texttt{multline} environment:
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:energy}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\rho\bigl(e + \lvert\vec{u}\rvert^2\big/2\bigr)\right]  + \nabla\cdot\left[\rho\bigl(h + \lvert\vec{u}\rvert^2\big/2 \bigr)\vec{u}\right] \\
 ={}-\nabla \cdot \vec{q} +  \rho \vec{u}\cdot\vec{g}+ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\bigl(d_{ji}u_i\bigr) + \dot{Q}_v
\end{multline}
An example using \texttt{align} appears in Appendix~\ref{appendix:a}.

An experimental package for setting equations that span two columns, \texttt{asmewide.sty}, can be loaded as well, but that code may require hand-fitting around figures, tables, and page breaks. See the examples in~\cite{lienhard2022}. An alternative solution may be to set large equations into two-column-wide tables or figures. 

Math italics are used for Roman and Greek letters by default.  If you want an upright letter in math, you can use the relevant math alphabet, e.g., \verb|\mathrm, \mathbf, \mathsf|:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dw}
\vec{F} = m \vec{a} \quad\textrm{or}\quad \vec{\mathrm{F}} = m \vec{\mathrm{a}} \quad\textrm{or}\quad \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} \quad\textrm{or}\quad \vec{\mathsf{F}} = m \vec{\mathsf{a}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The \texttt{newtxmath} and \texttt{unicode-math} Packages~\cite{sharpe1,robertson2023}} The \texttt{newtxmath} package, loaded by default with \pdfTeX, includes many options for mathematics, most of which can be called as options to \verb|\documentclass|. For example, the \texttt{upint} option selects upright integral signs (rather than slanted integral signs):
\begin{quote}
\verb|\documentclass[upint]{asmeconf}|. 
\end{quote}  
The option \verb|subscriptcorrection| improves the spacing of math subscripts. Math options are discussed further in the \texttt{asmeconf-template.tex} file.  The \texttt{newtxmath} package is also loaded with the \texttt{[nofontspec]} option.

To get additional symbols in bold math with \pdfTeX, use \verb|\bm{..}| from the \texttt{bm} package, which is loaded by the class. 

If using \LuaLaTeX, the math features of \texttt{unicode-math} are available.  These include commands to select a boldface, upright symbol, \verb|\symbfup{..}| or \verb|\mathbfup{..}|, to select boldface fraktur 
symbol, \verb|\symbffrak{..}| or \verb|\mathbffrak{..}|, and so on.  See the documentation of \texttt{unicode-math} for details~\cite{robertson2023}.

The \texttt{[upint]} option also works under \LuaLaTeX.

For longer passages of bold math, you can use \verb|{\mathversion{bold}..}| with either \pdfTeX\  or \LuaLaTeX: 
\verb|{\mathversion{bold} $A\otimes\mathfrak{F}$ }| gives {\mathversion{bold} $A\otimes\mathfrak{F}$}. Note that the math version must be changed \emph{before} starting math mode.


\subsection{Sans-Serif Greek Letters}
The class file also provides upright sans-serif Greek letters with \verb|\sfalpha| and similar expressions (e.g., $\sfalpha, \sfbeta, \sfgamma, \sfdelta$ \ldots ), in case they are needed. 

Under \pdfTeX\  boldface, upright, sans-serif Greek letters can be obtained with \verb|\bm{\sfalpha}|, etc.  The \texttt{newtx} package also includes options that affect whether Greek letters are upright or slanted (see that package's documentation for details).

Under \LuaLaTeX, boldface, sans-serif, upright Greek can be obtained with \verb|\sfbfalpha|, etc., or by using \verb|\symbfsfup{\alpha}|.  In the first case, the glyphs are drawn from the Lete Sans Math font, while in the second case, the glyphs are from the TeX Gyre Termes Math font.   Why are two different fonts being used? Unicode does not include medium-weight, upright, sans-serif Greek as a component of a serif font (like Termes), although it does include both upright and italic boldface Greek. However, in a sans-serif font (like Lete), Greek letters are sans-serif by default, including medium weight. (You can also invoke \verb|\symbfsfit{\alpha}| for  boldface, sans-serif, slanted type.) 

\subsubsection*{Sans-serif Math Versions} Two additional math versions, \texttt{sansbold} and \texttt{sans} are available in \texttt{asmeconf}.  The former is used by default in captions and section headings.  The latter is available in case you find a use for it. In \LuaLaTeX, both versions use the Lete Sans Math fonts. In \pdfTeX, the glyphs are from the \texttt{newtxsf} package.
  
  
\subsection{Controlling Calligraphic, Script, Fraktur, or BB Fonts}
With \pdfTeX, the \texttt{[mathalpha]} package may be loaded in the preamble~\cite{sharpe2}.\footnote{As of v1.41, the \texttt{[mathalfa]} class option has been dropped.} This package supports variety of font for calligraphic, fraktur, script, and blackboard bold fonts. For example,
\begin{center}
\verb|\usepackage[cal=euler,frak=boondox]{mathalpha}| 
\end{center}
selects the Euler font for \verb|\mathcal| and the Boondox font for \verb|\mathfrak|. Refer to the \texttt{mathalpha} documentation for details~\cite{sharpe2}.  The \texttt{[nofontspec]} option also supports \texttt{mathalpha}.

Under \LuaLaTeX, the \texttt{unicode-math} \texttt{range} function can be used to select such fonts~\cite{robertson2023}. For example, the following code in the preamble would select the Euler Math font for calligraphic, script, fraktur, and blackboard bold fonts:
\begin{quote}\raggedright
\verb|\setmathfont{Euler-Math}[|
\verb| range={cal,scr,frak,bb},|
\verb| Extension=.otf,Scale=MatchUppercase]|
\end{quote}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  ADDITIONAL PACKAGE OPTIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Additional Options for \NoCaseChange{\texttt{asmeconf.cls}}}
The class accepts a number of options in addition to those already described. These options are discussed next.

\subsection{Colored Hyperlinks}
ASME requires that all text be \textbf{in black} when the paper is submitted for publication.  For other uses, authors may
obtain colored hyperlinks with the [\texttt{colorlinks}] option.

\subsection{Final Column Balancing} The option \texttt{[balance]} invokes the the \texttt{flushend} package~\cite{tolusis}.
This package will attempt to give equal height to the two columns on the last page. The performance of this package is sometimes inconsistent (with odd page layout or, very rarely, errors), so use this option with caution.

\subsection{Grid-Style Author Block} The option \texttt{[grid]} invokes ASME's grid-style arrangement of author names. In the \verb|\SetAuthors{..}| command, individual author's names are recognized by the commas that separate them. (To include a comma \emph{in} a name, enclose the name in braces.) Line breaks (\verb|\\|) may be inserted into the address of \verb|\SetAffiliation{n}{address}| as needed. 

Note that ASME interprets the author order in the grid style by reading names from left-to-right in the top row, then left-to-right in each subsequent row.

\subsection{Line Numbers} The option \texttt{[lineno]} invokes the the \texttt{lineno} package~\cite{bottcher}. This option will produce line numbers in the margins. You must run \LaTeX\ \emph{twice} for proper placement of the numbers. Tables, captions, and footnotes will not be numbered.  Line numbers can be helpful for review and editing, but should not be used in your final manuscript. See the documentation of the \texttt{lineno} package for further commands to control line numbering. 

The \texttt{lineno} package is not compatible with the \texttt{flushend} package that makes final short columns the same height. Balancing is automatically disabled when this option is called. 

\subsection{Changing the Copyright Footer} The option \texttt{[nofoot]} will omit the ASME copyright from the page footer. The option \texttt{[govt]} will produce a copyright notice for authors who are employees of the U.\ S.\ Government.  
The option \texttt{[contractor]} will produce a copyright
notice for authors who are employed by a U.\ S.\ Government contractor.
The option \texttt{[somegovt]} gives a copyright notice for the case when only some authors are employees of the U.\ S.\ Government.

The footers are generated with the \texttt{fancyhdr} package~\cite{oostrum} and can be changed using the commands of that package. Only the default arrangement matches ASME's style, however.

In addition, the conference header on the title page can be omitted using the option \texttt{[nohead]}.

\subsection{Archivability:~PDF/A} In June 2022, the \LaTeX{}3 team added support for PDF/A to the \LaTeX\ kernel through the command \verb|\DocumentMetadata{..}|. This approach works with \emph{both} \pdfTeX\  and \LuaLaTeX. Note that accessible  conformance~(\texttt{a} or \texttt{UA-2} level, a.k.a.\ ``well-tagged PDF'') is still under development by the  \LaTeX3 team.

As of \texttt{asmeconf} v1.41, the legacy options \texttt{[pdf-a]}, \texttt{[pdfapart=]}, and \texttt{[pdfaconformance=]} have been dropped.

\subsection{Typewriter Font Options} This font is the sans-serif \texttt{inconsolata}. By default, the word spacing is variable, but option \texttt{[mono]} switches to monospacing. A slashed zero is the default; option \texttt{[var0]} removes the slash. Option \texttt{[hyphenate]} enables hyphenation. (The hyphenation option is not available under \LuaLaTeX\  with \texttt{fontspec}.)

\subsection{Support for Other Languages}  This package can be adapted to incorporate (or entirely use) languages other than English. See Appendix \ref{appendix:c} for details.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Nomenclature Environment  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Nomenclature Environment}
A nomenclature environment is included, as illustrated just after the abstract.  Each item in the nomenclature list is entered as \verb|\entry{symbol}{meaning}|.  Optional subheadings can be included as well: \verb|\EntryHeading{Roman letters}|.  The environment includes an optional argument for changing the space between symbols and definitions, 
\verb|\begin{nomenclature}[Xcm]|, where X is a number and cm can be replaced by any LaTeX dimensional unit: pt, in, ex, em, pc, etc. The default value is~2~em.

The title of the nomenclature can be also changed, e.g.\ \verb|\renewcommand*{\nomname}{List of Symbols}|

This brief illustration of an appendix shows the numbering of the appendix and equations. Equations are numbered
consecutively, following those in the paper. Consider $\rho \neq \textrm{fn}(p)$:
\begin{align}
\frac{d\Gamma}{dt} &{}= \frac{d}{dt} \int_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{u} \cdot d\mathbf{r}\\
				   &{}= \int_{\mathcal{C}} \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt} \cdot d\mathbf{r} + \underbrace{\int_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{u}\cdot d\biggl( \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}\biggr)}_{=\, 0} \\[-2pt]
                   &{}= \iint_{\mathcal{S}} \nabla \times \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt}  \cdot d\mathbf{A}\\
                   &{}= \iint_{\mathcal{S}}  \nabla p \times \nabla \left( \frac{1}{\rho}\right) \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section[Use with LuaLaTeX]{Use with \NoCaseChange{LuaLaTeX} }\label{appendix:b}

The \LuaLaTeX\  engine is useful with \texttt{asmeconf} in at least three situations:

\begin{description}

\item[Executing lua code directly in your \LaTeX\ file.] With lua code, complicated functions can be plotted or numerical integration can be executed. An example file in the distribution demonstrates this capability~\cite{lienhard2025}. In this situation, you can use the class option \texttt{[nofontspec]} to stay with the \texttt{newtx} fonts. (This setting does not support for non-Latin alphabets.)

\item[Using complex alphabets.] With \pdfTeX, \texttt{asmeconf} supports Latin alphabets, as well as Cyrillic, Greek, and Vietnamese. With \LuaLaTeX\  with the \texttt{fontspec} package you can use non-Latin fonts available on your computer if you call the \texttt{[loadscripts]} option.\footnote{For Latin scripts (including English) under \LuaLaTeX, you \emph{must} have these OpenType fonts (\texttt{.otf}) installed (all are in TeX Live and will be present if your installation is complete and up-to-date): TeX Gyre Termes X, TeX Gyre Termes Math, TeX Gyre Heros, Inconsolatazi4, LeteSansMath, STIX Two Math. For Greek and Russian, the Noto Serif, Sans, and Mono TrueType fonts (\texttt{.ttf}) are used, and other Noto fonts are used for south and east Asian scripts. The Noto fonts are \textbf{not} currently in TeX Live (go here: \hrefurl{https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts}{github.com/googlefonts/noto-fonts}).}\footnote{The \texttt{[loadscripts]} option was added in v1.42 of \texttt{asmeconf}, in order to reduce compilation time when non-Latin scripts are not needed.}   For Japanese in particular, use the class option \texttt{[japanese]}. See the example file in this distribution for more details~\cite{lienhard2021}.

\item[Producing tagged PDF.] Under \LuaLaTeX{}  with \texttt{unicode-math} (which loads by default), \texttt{asmeconf} PDF files can meet the PDF 2.0/UA-2 accessibility standard using appropriate arguments to \verb|\DocumentMetadata{..}| provided that: a) subcaptions are not used; b) any figure files meet the standard; and c) language options are used cautiously (some languages are compatible with tagging, but others currently are not). As of the Nov.~2025 released of \LaTeX{}, accessible PDF can be produced with the following settings:
\begin{quote}
	\verb|\DocumentMetadata{ | \newline
	\verb| pdfstandard = { ua-2 , a-4f },| \newline
	\verb| tagging = on }|
\end{quote}
Tagged PDF files can render accurately as HTML files (see \hrefurl{https://ngpdf.com}{ngpdf.com}). Version 1.44 of \texttt{asmeconf} includes a CSS style sheet control web appearance, \texttt{asmeconf-style.css}. 

\end{description}

For clarity, \texttt{fontspec} and \texttt{unicode-math} are automatically loaded when \texttt{asmeconf} is run under \LuaLaTeX. Those packages require that the necessary fonts are available on your computer.  If you wish to use \LuaLaTeX\  without the features of \texttt{unicode-math} and \texttt{fontspec}, use the class option \texttt{[nofontspec]}. 

Over the long-term, \LuaLaTeX\  will become the preferred engine for using \LaTeX\ (see \href{https://www.latex-project.org/news/latex2e-news/ltnews40.pdf}{\emph{LaTeX\ News}, Issue~40}). Access to \LuaLaTeX\  is different in each \LaTeX\ platform. Check the documentation for your platform to load \LuaLaTeX.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Multilingual Support}\label{appendix:c}

ASME publishes in English, but the \texttt{babel} package is loaded for 
users who may wish to include other languages. For example, an author might wish to include an appendix that provides the 
abstract in another language.

When more than one language option is included in \verb|\documentclass[..]{asmeconf}|, English will be 
set as the document's main language. (To choose a different main language, set \texttt{[main=..]}).
If no language options are given, the package defaults to English.  As examples, a passage in German is 
shown in  \selectlanguage{german}\appendixname~\ref{app:pohlhausen}\selectlanguage{english},
%\selectlanguage{french}\appendixname~\ref{app:fourier}\selectlanguage{english}, 
followed by abstracts in other languages.

% NOTE: The following template demo line contains raw UTF-8 glyphs (àáâä...).
% Some build setups can choke on this and stop compilation entirely.
% Comment it out to ensure robust compilation.
% The input encoding can be utf-8, as for these glyphs:
% %% If you have trouble with the next line, your file may not be saved in utf-8 format. You can delete that line to resolve the issue.
% \typeout{If you have trouble with the next line, your file may not be saved in utf-8 format. You can delete that line to resolve the issue. Under LuaLaTeX, you can load the fontspec will support these characters if you have the relevant systems fonts installed}%
% àáâäæãåā  èéęëêēė  îïíīįì ôöòóœøōõ ûüùúū çćč ł ñń ßśš ÿ žźż.

Fonts similar to Times/Helvetica are used when Greek, Vietnamese, or selected cyrillic-alphabet languages are called as options under {\upshape\pdfTeX}. Using {\upshape\LuaLaTeX}, which loads the fontspec package, many additional scripts are available; see the supplemental notes for such usage~\cite{lienhard2021}. Possibilities include Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Devanagari (e.g., for Hindi), Hangul (for Korean), Kana (for Japanese), and Tamil. \emph{These options require an up-to-date \LaTeX\ installation.}

The \texttt{asmeconf} class defines several switches that can be used to call languages only when certain class options have been called, as \verb|\if...\fi|: \verb|\ifScriptsLoaded|, \verb|\ifFontspecLoaded|, \verb|\ifpdftex|, and \verb|\ifJapaneseLoaded|.

The bibliography style, \texttt{asmeconf.bst}, is designed in English and aimed at \BibTeX.

\section{Wärmeaustausch und Reibungswiderstand (\NoCaseChange{von} E. Pohlhausen)}\label{app:pohlhausen}
In einer strömenden Flussigkeit sind Wärmeleitung und Wärmekonvektion Vorgänge, die mit der inneren Reibung (oder Impulsleitung) und mit der Impulskonvektion große Aehnlichkeit besitzen. Mathematisch findet dies seinen Ausdruck in dem gleichartigen Bau der Differentialgleichungen, die einerseits für die Temperatur und anderseits für den Geschwindigkeitsvektor in der Flüssigkeit bestehen. Man kann daraus auf eine Beziehung
zwischen dem Wärmeaustanch und dem Reibungswiderstand schließen, die eine strömende Flüssigkeit an einem festen Körper hervorrufen. Dies ist zuerst von Prandtl ausgesprochen und durchgeführt worden, und zwar für turbulente Vorgänge, unter der vereinfachenden Annahme von Wärmequellen und -senken im Innern der Flüssigkeit~\cite{pohlhausen1921}.
